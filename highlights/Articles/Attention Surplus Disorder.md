## Highlights
- the quality of our decisions generally improves when we're in more in tune with our feelings.
  But not always--and anxiety that fails to serve a useful purpose is a perfect example of the power of emotion.
- Note that emotion management is different than suppression; the latter is a futile (and even counterproductive) effort to ignore our feelings or deny their existence, while the former is a productive strategy of active engagement.
- Emotion management starts with heightening our ability to sense what we’re feeling.
- Practices such as regular exercise, sufficient sleep, and meditation help us attune to our bodies and the physiological manifestations of our anxiety.
- Once we can better sense our emotions as physical experiences, we can improve our ability to comprehend them, to label them with the appropriate words that allow us to translate what we’re (literally, physically) feeling into (conceptual) feelings.
- We’ve evolved a finely-tuned ability to be aware of others’ emotions, but we can’t necessarily interpret the precise nature and cause of those feelings.
- Sensing, comprehending, and articulating our emotions more effectively ultimately allow us to express those feelings in more productive ways.
- Wegner also suggests identifying an "absorbing distractor" that will prevent us from becoming fixated on a more problematic focal point. If we can arrest our anxiety before we’re deeply in its grip, we can redirect our attention elsewhere away from the object of our concern. This can involve substituting an immersive activity for worrying, such as intense exercise or a stimulating cognitive task, or it can involve re-focusing our anxiety on a more useful object--an alternative issue that we have more control over.
- Wegner recommends that we build our capacity to resist distraction by committing to address unwanted thoughts during some designated period.
