## Highlights
- Make sure that at least three apply. If only one or two do, you’re trying to resolve the situation too narrowly. Expand your attention, think about the implications of the action and the concerns of all involved, and let the situation develop until a third outcome card applies.
  Depending on your game, there might be outcome cards that you always include. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01fywpddr7rj73gfh99xc1gjsy))
- Here’s the simplest rule we’ve used for gathering your dice:
  > **Gathering Your Dice** 
  > Gather 1 die per outcome card. 
  > If you’re unimpaired, unexhausted, and free to act, add 1 die. 
  > If you have any particular strengths or advantages that apply, add 1 die. (If you have more than 1, still add only 1 die.)
  …But your game might call for a different system. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01fywpeaysxzp1vx9jtp05jfch))
- Otherkind Dice don’t need elaborate surrounding systems to make a whole game. They need:
  • Strong characters…
  • …In an unstable situation…
  • …Who have no choice but to act. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01fywph8qqpnfb0ch96dg1nr0r))
- When you create a more elaborate system, be sure to hook it, some way some how, into the outcome cards. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01fywpscqp4ags0atyzrv52sdr))
- If you’re looking for rpg rules that respect your character, highlight your character’s strengths, and help your character triumph, Otherkind Dice aren’t the rules you’re looking for. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01fywpt3tm6hmtvxext8evfey3))
