## Highlights
- The paradigm traces its origins to at least the 1980s, when researchers looked at how the media covered anti-war protests. It’s the idea that “the press contributes to the political status quo by reinforcing whatever the government thinks,” said Danielle Kilgo, a professor of journalism at the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities.
- A 2010 study that analyzed 40 years of protest coverage in five major newspapers, including The New York Times and The Washington Post, found that the papers depicted protests — even peaceful ones — as nuisances rather than as necessary functions of democracy.
- Centering protest coverage around the impact on traffic, local businesses, and property is one way that the protest-as-nuisance framing manifests.
