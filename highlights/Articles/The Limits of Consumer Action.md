## Highlights
- power at the point of production is a completely different lever than power at the point of consumption
- Laws change primarily because the affected groups build power that can no longer be ignored, not through the valiant efforts of lone heroes acting out of charity instead of solidarity.
- The first problem is that it glosses over the fact that consumers don’t always have an option to consume (or not consume) in a way that is “ethical”
- The other is that it neglects the true source of value under capitalism: labour.
- Treating consumers as the most viable originators of social change is a deeply flawed lens through which to see the world, and it gives rise to some questionable political assumptions.
