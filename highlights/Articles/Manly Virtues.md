## Highlights
- articulating any definition of non-toxic masculinity would be inherently reductive: to speak to men as men and not as individuals, they would say, is unavoidably to shore up a gender binary that should be dismantled.
  Yet in the absence of positive alternative visions of masculinity, the vacuum has been filled by those who speak with force and clarity – for better or (more often) for worse. 
- To the extent that Du Mez is right, Christian masculinity has been defined more by culture than by scripture – and so it has little to offer men beyond the toxicities of the “traditional” model.
- But Christianity does have more to offer. It has at its core the person of Jesus Christ, God made man. Turning away from his personhood leaves Christian men without a compelling alternative; turning toward it offers growth through a masculinity emphasizing compassion, humility, and purpose.
