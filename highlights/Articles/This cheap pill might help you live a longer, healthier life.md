## Highlights
- in the case of metformin, there can be rare and serious side-effects — including a condition called lactic acidosis, which can come with serious damage to people’s livers and kidneys. The most common side effect, though, is stomach discomfort.
- A study of more than 41,000 metformin users between the ages of 68 and 81 concluded that metformin reduced the likelihood of dementia, cardiovascular disease, cancer, frailty, and depression, and not by a small amount
- Though not all cancers are suppressed––prostate, bladder, renal, and esophageal cancer seem recalcitrant––more than twenty-five studies have shown a powerful protective effect, sometimes as great as a 40 percent lower risk, most notably for lung, colorectal, pancreatic, and breast cancer.
