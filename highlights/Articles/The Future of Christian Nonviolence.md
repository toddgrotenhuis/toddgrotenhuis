## Highlights
- But is it nonviolence? Is it disarmament? Disarmament occurs when people lay down their weapons, not when their weapons are taken from them. That only moves belligerents to procure more and better weapons if they can. When activists destroy weapons, do they effect any conversion or change of heart in their opponents? Do they lead any to lay down their arms? Are such actions what we need? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01fxtda2pae66n8q7mhk0ngkch))
- The basis of Christian nonviolence is the same premise that underlies all of the church’s social teaching: that every man, woman, and child is created in the image of God. Persons are never a means to an end; they are ends in themselves, and thus are not to be violated in any way, either in body, mind, or spirit. Persons are not disconnected individuals in a war of all against all, as in the capitalist model; nor are they to be subsumed into a larger whole, as in the collectivist model. Instead, all are formed in, by, and for community. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01fxtdhvsmh1zm3m8dwaqrgbrd))

- Christian discipleship will be judged by the criteria of the Last Judgment: the works of mercy that Jesus describes in Matthew 25. As Dorothy Day pointed out, war may be judged by these criteria too, for the works of war are the exact opposite of the works of mercy. Feed the hungry? No, destroy their crops! Give drink to the thirsty? No, poison their wells! Shelter the homeless? No, bomb their village! The weapons of Christian nonviolence include the spiritual works of mercy; again, the works of war are the exact opposite. Instruct the ignorant? No, lie to them! Counsel the doubtful? No, draft them or imprison them! Console the bereaved? Give them more deaths to grieve! Forgive injuries? Not on your life! Make them pay, ten times over!

- Authentic nonviolence must be revolutionary because the social, political, economic order we live under violates the human person in fundamental ways – body, mind, and spirit. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01fxv4scgcpx8nxbf0yrjdgcjr))
- In struggle, the nonviolent activist does not seek victory but reconciliation, the redemption of the opponent, never his humiliation or annihilation. Therefore, the nonviolent activist always allows the opponent a way to retreat with dignity, an honorable way out of any conflict.

- Christian nonviolence is a way of life, not a tactic. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01fxvgayq3dmn4z749cdhedvdk))
