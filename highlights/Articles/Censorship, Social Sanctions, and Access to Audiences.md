## Highlights
- The primary focus of the current “free speech” debate are not threats of this sort at all, but the threat of social sanction. I do not think we can make a principled case for a generalized freedom from social sanction.
- In the age of the Internet, social media, and the smartphone, many messages can reach the broader public even in a society with strict state censorship and harsh social sanctions.
- These, then, are three distinct questions that the current debate over “free speech” runs together in a sloppy fashion:
  * __Is the state engaging in acts of censorship?__
  * __Are social sanctions against speech or beliefs too harsh?__
  * __Is our media ecosystem sufficiently open?__
  Failure to disentangle these questions has resulted in the current abysmal state of the conversation.

- That is why we should not allow other, broader concerns to be gerrymandered into the legal ideal of freedom of speech. 
- Freedom of speech, understood as nothing more or less than freedom from state censorship, still requires a zealous defense. Such a defense calls for conceptual clarity and careful distinctions between this ideal and others, however closely related they may be.
- The outcomes of freedom of association are not neutral or egalitarian, however. Not everyone is in a position to organize in the first place.
- some people are put in a position to put the livelihood and comfort of other people in jeopardy.
- However one chooses to go about it, mitigating the material downsides to freedom of association is the most direct way to address the way disassociation gets turned into a tool of social sanctioning.
- It is therefore very odd that so much energy is expended attempting to persuade the mob, however large, to have more self-control, when that simply does not scale.
- Rather than hoping for self-discipline, or reasoned calculation, or the better angels of our nature, critics of “cancel culture” really ought to be thinking structurally.
- But the very concentration that makes such potential virality possible also puts most online content under the governance of a handful of corporations.
