## Highlights
- If it's important, critical, or fundamental, write it up, don't chat it down.
- Writing solidifies, chat dissolves. Substantial decisions start and end with an exchange of complete thoughts, not one-line-at-a-time jousts. If it's important, critical, or fundamental, write it up, don't chat it down.
- Speaking only helps who’s in the room, writing helps everyone. This includes people who couldn't make it, or future employees who join years from now.

- Never expect or require someone to get back to you immediately unless it’s a true emergency. The expectation of immediate response is toxic.

- Ask yourself if others will feel compelled to rush their response if you rush your approach.
- If you want an answer, you have to ask a question. People typically have a lot to say, but they'll volunteer little. Automatic questions on a regular schedule help people practice sharing, writing, and communicating.
- Occasionally pick random words, sentences, or paragraphs and hit delete. Did it matter?
- If something's going to be difficult to hear or share, invite questions at the end. Ending without the invitation will lead to public silence but private conjecture. This is where rumors breed.
    - Note: oh this is interesting in light of the blow-up at Basecamp in 2021
- When titling something, lead with the most important information. Keep in mind that many technical systems truncate long text or titles.
- Great news delivered on the heels of bad news makes both bits worse. The bad news feels like it's being buried, the good news feels like it's being injected to change the mood. Be honest with each by giving them adequate space.
- Ask if things are clear. Ask what you left out. Ask if there was anything someone was expecting that you didn't cover.
- When someone relies on search to find something it’s often because it wasn’t where they expected something to be.
- Communication often interrupts, so good communication is often about saying the right thing at the right time in the right way with the fewest side effects.
