## Highlights
- Beyond leavening presence, a second type of Christian political action that doesn't seek to take control of the state is action that I'll describe as "creating a new world in the shell of the old."
- Political theologians from an Anabaptist tradition describe how Christian community is to function as a counter or contrasting polis to the nation state. That is, the Christian community is to embody and instantiate a politics, a way of sharing life together that displays an economy of material, relational, and spiritual commitment and care.
- And beyond Christianity, we see all sorts of other intentional communities, nomadic lifeways, communes, and anarchist experiments where people are trying to escape the tyranny of the state and market.
- It is common in Christian discourse about the church to describe the church as a counter-polis to the world. Few churches, however, actually embody a new and different politics, where the material fortunes of its members are tightly knit together in a shared fabric of interdependency and mutuality.
- To be sure, as we noted in the contrast between Christian realism and revolution, we can recognize a continuum here. There are gradations between leavening presence and intentional community. Christian communities and churches can express a range of material commitments in their common life, and smaller groups within a church can share life together in very intentional ways. And beyond material sharing, there are a host of ways of sharing cultural life together
