## Highlights
- The underlying problem tends to be that the organization hasn’t agreed on what their engineering management role entails. Instead, each interviewer relies on their personal preferences or previous experiences to assess candidates.
- You can self-assess your organization’s alignment on the engineering management role by asking interviewers what they value, but it’s easier to just go to the metrics. If you’re giving offers to less than 20% of folks coming onsite, something’s wrong. Spend a few weeks incorporating frequent rejection reasons into your upstream phone screen. If your rejection rate remains low afterwards, it’s quite unlikely you don’t have internal alignment on what you need from engineering managers.
- Once you’ve established this as a problem:
  Think about what you need engineering managers to do
  Refine those tasks into four or five key skills for the role
  Create an interview to evaluate each of those skills
  Create a rubric to score each of those interviews
  Train the interviewing team on the new interviews and rubrics
  Remove interviewers from the loop if they refuse to use the rubric
