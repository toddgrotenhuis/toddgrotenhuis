## Highlights
- There’s no need to reject how biologists define the sexes to defend the view that trans women are women. When we look across the diversity of life, sex takes stranger forms than anyone has dreamt of for humans. The biological definition of sex takes all this in its stride. It does so despite the fact that there are no more than two biological sexes in any species you’re likely to have heard of. To many people, that might seem to have ‘conservative’ implications, or to fly in the face of the diversity we see in actual human beings. I will make clear why it does not.
- Because they produce two kinds of gametes, hermaphroditic species still have two biological sexes – they simply combine them in one organism.
- There’s no obvious reason why complex multicellular organisms need to have two kinds of gamete, or why these two kinds are so different in size and structure. It’s perfectly possible to make three or more different kinds of gamete, or gametes that vary continuously, just as people vary continuously in height. One question that biologists seek to answer, then, is why those forms of sexual reproduction aren’t observed in complex organisms such as animals and plants.
