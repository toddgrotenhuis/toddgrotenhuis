## Highlights
- Apple controls who can and cannot compete in virtually all sectors of the digital economy through the monopoly power they wield capriciously with the App Store.
- ...nobody is asking for a free ride here! If it costs Apple more than hundreds of millions of dollars to run the App Store, they can raise their prices. We’d gladly pay $199/year for a developer license.
  But what Apple is asking for is a cut of revenues...
- Google’s Play Store policies are essentially the same as Apple’s, although they’ve wielded them slightly less aggressively so far. But make no mistake, if Apple gets off scot-free, Google is surely coming for their 30% cut of the entire digital economy as well.
- the big four tech companies have captured insufferable monopolies that they’re using to distort and shakedown markets, prevent new companies from succeeding, and ensure they never actually have to compete on the merits of innovation.
