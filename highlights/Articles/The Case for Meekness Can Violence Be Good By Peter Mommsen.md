## Highlights
- The disconnect shows up most blatantly when so-called Christian nationalists take the symbol of the cross – the sign of an executed Jew who refused to defend himself – and turn it into a badge for a semiautomatic-toting tribalism. It’s hard to imagine anything more alien to the way of the Jesus of the Gospels.
- This habit of mind extends across the left–right spectrum to both critical race theorists and integralist theocons. If what matters is the contest for raw power, then coercion is a necessary tool.
- Yet the Beatitude must apply even in times of conflict, or it doesn’t apply at all.
