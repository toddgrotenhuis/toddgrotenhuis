## Highlights
- Economic elites played an important role in financing and encouraging this shift, the authors argue; the biggest gains in support for the fascists occurred in places where entrepreneurs and rentiers accounted for a larger share of the local population.
- Support for the socialists in Italy rose sharply after the first world war. In response to this, the centre-right establishment, fearful of the socialists, threw its support behind Benito Mussolini’s fascists. Economic elites played an important role in financing and encouraging this shift, the authors argue; the biggest gains in support for the fascists occurred in places where entrepreneurs and rentiers accounted for a larger share of the local population.
- Results like these suggest that whether economic crises prove destructive of democratic institutions depends in large part on social forces that can be slow-moving. Plausible authoritarian explanations for what went wrong can influence voters’ willingness to tear down political systems. So, too, can the extent to which influential people hew to or defect from prevailing norms. Fixing what’s broken ought to be governments’ priority when a nasty shock hits, but the work does not end there. A full recovery may also require clear communication about what went wrong and why—and vigilance in the face of efforts to undermine democracy. ■
