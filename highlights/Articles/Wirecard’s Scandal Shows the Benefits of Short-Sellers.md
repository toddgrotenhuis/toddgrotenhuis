## Highlights
- Questions about the firm’s accounting began to swirl in 2015 (see article). They have intensified in the past 18 months with a series of articles in the Financial Times, informed by short-sellers and whistle-blowers. Instead of taking these seriously, Germany’s markets regulator, BaFin, seemed keener to shore up confidence in Wirecard and attack the attackers. It temporarily banned shorting of the firm’s stock, a first, and opened a criminal case against journalists for suspected manipulation.
- Those who bet against companies have long been eyed with suspicion; short-selling bans date back to 17th-century Amsterdam. But claims that shorting causes instability do not hold water: financial crises are more often caused by investors borrowing to go long, not short.
- They have to face writs and illegal tactics, too—Wirecard is suspected of ordering cyber-attacks on its critics.
- Shorting does more than just root out funny business. It also helps sharpen price discovery when legitimate firms are overvalued. Short-sellers tend to do their homework because they have a lot at stake.
