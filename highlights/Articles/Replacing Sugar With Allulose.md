## Highlights
- In this context, velocity can be thought of as the speed it takes sugar to hit our system and affect our metabolism. Fiber plays an important role here. Unlike most carbohydrates, fiber is largely not digested by the human body but is metabolized by bacteria in the colon. It slows digestion of other carbs, which is why it’s better to eat sugar with fiber.
- The problem with the cumulative amount of sugar consumed in most modern societies today is that we effectively make our bodies believe it is wintertime all year round. The reality is that we don’t need to store energy as if we are preparing for a time of food scarcity, as animals do before hibernation.

- It would be enough if allulose didn’t elicit a physiologic response in the way that other carbohydrates do (i.e., increase blood sugar, insulin response, de novo lipogenesis). But allulose may induce a number of other intriguing and beneficial responses. Data from animal studies suggest that compared to fructose and/or glucose, allulose may lower blood glucose, reduce abdominal fat, decrease insulin resistance and fat accumulation in the liver, and prevent or delay the onset of type 2 diabetes.
- I can anecdotally support that when I put allulose into black coffee, my blood glucose goes down. Usually black coffee would be neutral for my blood sugar, so this suggests that allulose is pulling glucose out of my body via my kidneys.
- While this study is about SGLT-2i and not allulose, it is reassuring that a drug that drags A LOT of glucose through the kidney to the bladder found no increase in cancer. 
- At the risk of sounding like the Consumer Reports of sugar alternatives, I favor allulose for the mouthfeel, safety profile, and of course its impact on blood glucose, followed by monk fruit. In my opinion, these are the only two non-“sugar” sweeteners that really taste like sugar. After that I would settle for alcohol sugars like erythritol and xylitol. But this is very much a matter of individual taste.
