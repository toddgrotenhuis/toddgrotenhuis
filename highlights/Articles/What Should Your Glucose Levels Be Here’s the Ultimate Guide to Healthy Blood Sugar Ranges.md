## Highlights
- Based on the data of healthy individuals wearing CGM, it appears that it is safe and healthy to strive for a fasting glucose between 72-85 mg/dL, a post-meal glucose level 110 mg/dL or lower, and an average glucose of 100 mg/dL or lower.

- According to the [American Diabetes Association](https://www.diabetes.org/a1c/diagnosis) (ADA), people can be classified into three categories depending on their fasting plasma glucose levels: normal, prediabetes, and diabetes. To be considered “normal,” fasting glucose must be under 100 mg/dl. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01fx4c9akv5v1e1wm30ete3z9e))
- According to the [International Diabetes Federation (IDF)](https://www.idf.org/component/attachments/attachments.html?id=728&task=download) guidelines for managing post-meal glucose levels, nondiabetic people should have a glucose level of no higher than 140 mg/dl after meals, and glucose should return to pre-meal levels within 2-3 hours. Post-meal hyperglycemia (elevated glucose) is defined as a glucose level >140 mg/dl 1-2 hours after the ingestion of food or drinks. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01fx4caj3nfyhp2829x8jy42sv))
- In summary, based on ADA criteria, the IDF guidelines, a person’s glucose values are “normal” if they have fasting glucose <100 mg/dl and a post-meal glucose level <140 mg/dl. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01fxh61prr6bacbtk5ah6s15h3))
- Taking into account additional research performed specifically using continuous glucose monitors, we can gain some more clarity on normal *trends* and can suggest that a nondiabetic, healthy individual can expect:
  • Fasting glucose levels between 80-86 mg/dl
  • Glucose levels between 70-120 mg/dl for approximately 90% of the day (and to *rarely ever* go above 140 mg/dl or below 60 mg/dl)
  • 24-hour mean glucose levels of around 89-104 mg/dl
  • Mean daytime glucose of 83-106 mg/dl
  • Mean nighttime glucose of 81-102 mg/dl
  • Mean post-meal glucose peaks ranging from 99.2 ± 10.5 to 137.2 ± 21.1 mg/dl
  • Time to post-meal glucose peak is around 46 minutes – 1 hour ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01fxh62mecpstwa0vdmxvfx7et))

- Fasting Glucose Goal: 72-85 Mg/dL ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01fxh6e3tjrbzb7kfcxrhdg4xv))
- Pre-Meal (Baseline) Glucose Goal: 72-90 mg/dL ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01fxh6frst9wbykxv3ahftfcge))
- Post-Meal Glucose Goal: Less Than 110 mg/dL, With No More Than A 30 mg/dL Increase From Pre-Meal Levels ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01fxh6h51d8v27w448e6fqrjrd))
- Mean 24-Hour Glucose Goal: 79-100 mg/dL ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01fxh6m7wecpsrr9bxkzmsq1bp))
- [Research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19388962) also shows that glucose levels decrease by an average of 5% during REM sleep compared to non-REM sleep stages, which may contribute to periodic dips seen at night in nondiabetic people ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01fxh6swhtfa2nj5savw7vc15g))
- glucose dips below 70 mg/dL that occur just after a post-meal glucose spike may indicate *reactive hypoglycemia*; which is an exaggerated insulin response to a high carbohydrate meal, causing an overshoot in the amount of glucose that is absorbed out of the bloodstream and into cells and is not good for health ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01fxh6teshwrhremsn66ht9fjk))

- A personalized [dietary](https://www.levelshealth.com/blog-category/nutrition) and [lifestyle](https://www.levelshealth.com/blog/12-glucose-lowering-strategies-to-improve-metabolic-fitness) plan that promotes metabolic health should also accomplish three main goals:
  1. Minimize post-meal increases in glucose levels
  2. Keep glucose levels as stable as possible and minimize swings in glucose throughout the day
  3. Try to keep fasting glucose in the low end of the “normal” range ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01fxh6x2p1esfs3mj7p7gzgj9x))
