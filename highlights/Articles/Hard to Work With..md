## Highlights
- It’s a truism that you always want to hire folks with very high standards, but I’ve seen a staggering number of folks fail in an organization primarily because they want to hold others to a higher standard than their organization’s management is willing to enforce.

- As you look at enough of these scenarios, you can back out a common pattern. The main character is trying to do their job effectively, but can’t due to the low performance of a peer. They escalate to the appropriate manager to address the issue, but that manager transforms the performance issue into a relationship issue: it’s not that the peer isn’t performing, it’s just that the two of you don’t like each other. Instead of being the manager’s responsibility to resolve the performance issue, it’s now the main character’s responsibility. By attempting to drive accountability in their peer, the main character has blocked their own progress (“they’re just hard to work with”) without accomplishing anything.

- What I’ve come to appreciate is that the appropriate manager is almost always aware of the underlying issue, and for some reason they’re simply unwilling to confront it. You think that you’re bringing a new problem to that manager to solve, but what you’re actually doing is trying to hold that manager accountable for not solving a known problem, which more often than not ends poorly when they’re more senior than you.

- If you still want to have a direct discussion, you can usually have a direct conversation about why they’re comfortable maintaining the status quo. You can even add more context about how it’s impacting you or the team you work with. Sometimes this will lead to change, but it’s a slow process. You’re not going to change their mind overnight.

- What I’ve found effective in these cases is to lead with constructive energy directed towards a positive outcome. Even if you can’t get your peer’s performance addressed directly, you can often overcome your peer’s bad performance by generating excitement in the direction you want to go. Enough excitement will give the resolution avoidant manager a way to solve their problem without actually engaging with the situation that they’re unwilling to address.
