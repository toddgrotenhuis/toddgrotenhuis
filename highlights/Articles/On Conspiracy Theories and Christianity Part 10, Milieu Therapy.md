## Highlights
- I want to suggest that when it comes to conspiratorial beliefs we should think of church as milieu therapy. A pastor can't preach or teach people out of believing in QAnon. Again, debate and argument are going to fail. But what church leaders can do is promote a culture and environment that makes it hard for conspiracy theories to grow and thrive.
  What might that look like? Here is where this long series proves helpful. We've walked through a variety of things that promote conspiracy theories. Rather than attacking the conspiracy theory directly, which will only promote defensiveness and departure from the church, we can undermine many of the things that feed and grow conspiratorial belief.
  For example, pastors can get prophetic about affective polarization, call the church to pull back from social media, decenter Washington DC, undermine nationalism, foster capacities for lament in the face of shared tragedy, and teach a responsible eschatology. Along with this the ongoing work of the church in meeting our social and existential needs. All this can be done without mentioning QAnon directly. Energetic and persistent work across all these fronts creates a milieu where it is hard for conspiracy theories to grow and flourish.
- And let me underline the word persistent. One can't do a teaching series on any of these topics and think you've checked a box. This isn't a one off intervention. You're creating a milieu.
