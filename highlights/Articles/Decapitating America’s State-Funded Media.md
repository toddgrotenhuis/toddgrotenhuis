## Highlights
- Government interference in news gathering and editorial decisions is prohibited by law. But firing the directors sent a clear signal.
  To those who rely on the American news agencies, it all seemed dismally familiar. In Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary or Russia, the sequence is routine. An independent news outlet is taken over by allies of an oligarch or political party. The editors resign or are fired. Next comes an abrupt shift to a government-friendly editorial line.
- The roles played by the American-funded news agencies vary. The most important in eastern Europe is RFE/RL, which broadcasts in native languages and sponsors local subsidiaries. In Romania, Bulgaria and Ukraine, where most newspapers and television channels are owned by oligarchs who use them to slander their enemies, it provides a rare source of impartial information. In Hungary, nearly all media have fallen into the hands of businessmen friendly with Prime Minister Viktor Orban or of a foundation controlled by his Fidesz party.
