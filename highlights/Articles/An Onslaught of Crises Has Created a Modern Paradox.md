## Highlights
- crisis fatigue is a very natural human response: The whole nature of crises is that they're new and shocking. And inevitably, as soon as you've thought about and lived with the crisis for a while, it becomes the new normal.
- particularly among the younger generations, the existence of some form of existential crisis—be it fiscal, environmental, democratic, medical—is the new normal. In many ways, the respite that you get now, between the next crisis crashing down on you, is increasingly small.
- We live in a media-saturated context, where catastrophizing is the common denominator. If there's a molehill, it will become a mountain. And this degree of social amplification, driven by 24/7 social media, driven by the fact that now everybody can be an expert, the low cost of access to mass global platforms—it means that the noise level is constantly at a very high volume. So I think there is a big issue out there around almost the layering, or sedimentation, of crises upon crises upon crises, that risks eroding our sense of social achievement, actually, and resilience.
- We spent our entire evolutionary history worrying about escaping a tiger, finding food, those kinds of tangible crises. We are bombarded with this constant stream of intangible crises, but at the same time, we're living a much more comfortable life than we were 20,000 years ago.
- The realist view is that this is all part of a pattern that is unlikely to be broken, unless you get a real crisis that brings the dominant economic model that we currently have to its knees. However, I would like to suggest that there is a far more positive interpretation because maybe, just maybe, what Covid has shown is that it is impossible to address collective social challenges and social risks as individuals.
