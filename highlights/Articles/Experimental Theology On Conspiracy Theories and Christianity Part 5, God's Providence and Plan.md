## Highlights
- We're comforted by causal explanations. Randomness spooks the brain and makes us anxious. We hunger for a orderly, predictable world. So making connections between events soothes and puts us at ease. So, there is solace to be found in facing a trauma or failure knowing that somehow, someway, this is a part of God's plan. 
  But here is the critical issue. There is a vast epistemological and emotional difference between knowing that a plan exists and knowing exactly what that plan is in a given circumstance. This is a fine line, but people do cross it. Something happens and people step up to explain exactly what God is doing in this circumstance. What is mysterious and hidden to us is clear and explicit to these people.
- lament is the opposite of conspiratorial thinking
