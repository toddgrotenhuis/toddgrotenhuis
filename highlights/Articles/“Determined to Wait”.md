## Highlights
- I was one of a series of international journalists who had come to investigate why Pakistan couldn’t eradicate polio, even as the rest of the world, including many impoverished nations with poor public health infrastructure, had. There was an air of condescension in all the reporting, even my own. Western media seemed to be saying: Look at these poor, backwards people. Over 70 polio vaccinators have been killed in Pakistan since 2012, when the public learned that, as part of a covert operation designed to locate Osama bin Laden, the CIA disguised attempts to collect DNA that could link back to bin Laden as a Hepatitis B vaccination campaign.
