## Highlights
- They don’t talk at all about the damage that deep-seated white supremacist ideas and unfounded fears of and threats posed by the presence of black people in what are thought to be white spaces (neighborhoods, parks, pools, apartment buildings, senior leadership roles) does to the white psyche.
- Stare into the abyss, the hole, the missing parts of your humanity that keep you from being able to connect deeply with people of color beyond the comforts of the workplace where invariably you hold positions of power and authority or through the lens of sports and entertainment.
