## Highlights
- Imperfect information is given in practically all markets, but this condition is exaggerated under hierarchical capitalist institutions where managers compete with workers, opaque concentrations of private power are protected by the state, and politicians have a vested interest in misleading constituents
- The narratives spun by data at the corporate level are not necessarily intended to inform rational business decision making but to justify predetermined imperatives that primarily serve to cement established power dynamics.
- The common thread I have found in my experience of corporate life is that we do not fit conclusions to data but data to conclusions.
- More-stringent, top-down imperatives wouldn’t erase underlying conflicts of interests, but would only push them into the shadows while also further alienating workers who already lack control over their day-to-day lives.
- In a hierarchical organization, there are misalignments of incentives at every level as a result of the hierarchy. These misalignments produce the need for people to bridge gaps in communication and self-interest in order to facilitate action. 
- As Carson has argued at length, decentralized production would quickly outcompete centralized, bureaucratic organizations, if not for the fact that our current, heavily subsidized, capitalist markets dedicate much of their capacity to reproducing concentrations of power.
