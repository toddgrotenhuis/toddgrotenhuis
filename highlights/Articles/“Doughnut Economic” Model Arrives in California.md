## Highlights
- “Doughnut Economics.” The “doughnut” is an idea that was first presented by renegade economist Kate Raworth in her bestselling 2017 book, “Doughnut Economics: Seven Ways to Think Like a 21st-Century Economist.” 
  The idea is based on an image that contains two rings. The inner ring represents our social foundation and the outer ring represents our ecological ceiling. The goal of the “doughnut” model is to get humanity into the doughy center — the space where we are meeting our economic needs while remaining within planetary boundaries.
