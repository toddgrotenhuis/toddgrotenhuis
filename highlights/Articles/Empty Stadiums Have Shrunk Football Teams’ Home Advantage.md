## Highlights
- Sure enough, officials no longer appear biased. Although the pattern varies widely by league, the total share of cards received by home teams has risen from 46% before lockdowns to 50% afterwards.
- With crowds watching, home teams gained 58% of points; without them, hosts have still earned 56%.
- Since May, hosts have taken 53% of shots at goal—less than the 55% they took in full stadiums, but enough to give them an edge
