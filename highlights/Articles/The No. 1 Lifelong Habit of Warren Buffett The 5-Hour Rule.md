## Highlights
- Here are Drucker’s six factors to knowledge worker productivity:
- Prioritization. Knowledge worker productivity demands that we ask the question: “What is the task?”
- Autonomy. It demands that we impose the responsibility for their productivity on the individual knowledge workers themselves. Knowledge workers have to manage themselves.
- Innovation. Continuing innovation has to be part of the work, the task and the responsibility of knowledge workers.
- Learning. Knowledge work requires continuous learning on the part of the knowledge worker, but equally continuous teaching on the part of the knowledge worker.
- Quality. Productivity of the knowledge worker is not — at least not primarily — a matter of the quantity of output. Quality is at least as important.
- Purpose. Finally, knowledge worker productivity requires that the knowledge worker is both seen and treated as an “asset” rather than a “cost.” It requires that knowledge workers want to work for the organization in preference to all other opportunities.
