## Highlights
- The Provoker is original perhaps to a fault: Ambitious, wide-ranging, risk-taking, Provokers claim to know a lot more than they actually do but can be exceptionally useful in forcing readers to think about new things or think in new ways.
- The Explainer knows stuff I don’t know and can present it clearly and vividly
- The Illuminator is definitionally original: someone who shines a clear strong light on some element of history or human experience that I never knew existed.
