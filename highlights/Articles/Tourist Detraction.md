## Highlights
- It took a pandemic to stop the gluttonous consumption of other places, trips that relied centrally on the have-nots—armies of hotel workers, cleaners, food preparers, bartenders, pool attendants—to provide the lavish experience sought. The argument in favor of this juxtaposition was that tourists, however noxious, were propping up the GDP of places like Macau (51 percent), Maldives (32.5 percent), Spain (14.6 percent), and Italy (13.2 percent). It was, as neoliberal economics go, a top-down model, mere cents going to the worst-off at the bottom.
  Figures like these are routinely tossed about as a kind of imperative for the continuation of an industry that has an exploitative and extractive effect on local economies. While some find it convenient to believe that local economies flourish when beautiful places are monetized, studies of “leakage” show that a large amount of money spent locally by tourists leaves those economies. Furthermore, the “jobs” created are largely low-skilled, wage-earner jobs or even limited gigs that do not deliver people out of the economic precariousness that Americans lament pervades their own society.
- Indeed, if pre-Covid Instagram is any indication, the amount of “learning” travelers do—the degree of local or global understanding that is the product of their cavorting—doesn’t seem to be particularly significant. In general, tourists, however far they may have traveled, are there for short moments in which they remain by and large in the same psychological space they inhabited back home.
- Tourism should never be resuscitated in the form in which it existed. Those who love travel must be forced to consider how their gluttony for it has affected others. The power difference between tourists and locals must be recalibrated so that it is interdependence, rather than servitude, that defines the relationship. This might mean fewer “experiences” but more understanding. Fewer people will be able to go and fewer places will be seen, but travel will also be less injurious, less rapacious in its unthinking imposition of injustices and inconveniences on so many. The question is longer when can I be a tourist again, but what kind of tourist do I want to be?
