## Highlights
- To summarize again:
  When Christians attempt take control of history they act to influence the nation state, directing policy toward desired ends. This attempt at taking historical responsibility can take two forms, presented as options but really existing along a continuum:
  > **1. Christian Realism**
  > 
  > Christians can engage with the politics of the state as it exists, accepting that political progress is incremental and that political arrangements can only ever be approximations of the kingdom of God. Examples of Christian realism are Christians (Democrats or Republicans) who, as voters, community organizers, and activists, seek political change in America.
  > 
  > **2. Christian Revolution**
  > 
  > Christians engaged in revolutionary politics seek to directly undermine or overthrow the politics of the nation state, likely because the politics of the state are so broken or evil the political status quo has to replaced wholesale and immediately. An example of Christian revolution would be the actions of John Brown in his attempts to overthrow American slavery. You could also argue that the insurrectionists of January 6th were engaged in revolutionary political action in their attempt to overthrow the results of the 2020 American election.
  When Christian political action eschews taking responsibility for history it can express itself in one of three ways:
  > **3. Leavening Presence**
  > 
  > Christians engaged in leavening presence humanize the world by pushing back against dehumanizing forces by offering care, material support, safety, advocacy, and solidarity. Individual Christians can do this in their places of work and influence by using their power compassionately. Christian churches and organizations, through a variety of ministries and programs, also respond to locations of harm, suffering, material want, marginalization, and oppression. Examples here include any Christian trying to act compassionately in their workplace and all the Christian charity and advocacy work throughout the world.
  > 
  > **4. A New World in the Shell of the Old**
  > 
  > Christians can form intentional communities as a counter-*polis* in the midst of the world, instantiating a politics, economy, and common life in contrast to that of the reigning political powers and institutions. Such communities live among the nations as a "colony of heaven" and bear witness, in their common life, to the politics of the kingdom of God. Such communities do not seek to make the kingdoms of the world conform to the politics of heaven but, rather, bring into existence "a new world in the shell of the old." Examples here include Anabaptist communities (like the Amish and Bruderhof) and Christian monastic communities, new and old.
  > 
  > **5. Sacramental Witness**
  > 
  > In their ritual and sacramental life Christians make visible the politics of heaven in the midst of the world. Artistic and performative expressions also embody a sacramental witness when they interrupt political and economic imaginations held captive by the status quo. The sacramental manifestation of the politics of heaven in the midst of the world creates an eschatological and prophetic contrast with the kingdoms of men. Examples here are Christian worship and the celebration of the Table along with artistic and performative acts of protest. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01fxqc3jh85prtk5mjrp666mv2))
- You can't maintain a consistent peace witness while involved with the state. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01fxqc4ax2d45rjjxbhkm97eac))
