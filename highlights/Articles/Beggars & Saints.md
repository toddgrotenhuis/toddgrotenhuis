## Highlights
- In his second speech at the MWC assembly, “The Peace Witness and Modern Revolutionary Movements,” Harding said that before Mennonites judged the violent tactics of the Black Power movement or the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam or the revolutionary movements in Peru and Colombia, Mennonites needed to go and spend at least six months with these revolutionaries. Mennonites needed to hear their deepest concerns, learn what it felt like to have one’s back up against the wall and then decide if the peace witness had anything to offer.
- “They saw whiteness as a protection from conflict and confusion and difficulties,” he told me, “and chose not to come out from under that protection.”
  He understood all this, and he expected more. Harding was calling Mennonites to integrity in their peace witness. He expected that the persecution European descent Mennonites had experienced would compel them to come alongside their Black sisters and brothers in the freedom struggle. He expected it could help them to come alongside the many revolutionary movements around the world. This was the challenge he posed at the MWC assembly in Amsterdam.
  But generally that was not the response from white Mennonites. There were outliers who got involved in the Southern Freedom Movement, but, by and large, white Mennonites and Mennonite institutions stayed on the sidelines.
