## Highlights
- Recently I've heard two goals:
  The goal of technology is to become a brain extension, helping you to decide what to do and then helping you get it done.
  The goal of technology is to become a hand-held power tool, helping you accomplish the things you've already decided to do
  That's not the same thing. It turns out the difference is critical.
- This is the more important point. It's not that the platforms turn what might be complex things into simple numbers, or even that they monetize attention. It's that by turning everything into numbers, over time they destroy the distinction between the categories entirely. Platforms are the enemy because they resist analysis in the areas they dominate.
- In our desire to help, we harm the very people we're trying to assist -- by subtly giving them the impression that this is a solved problem. 
- Popular platforms aren't just a danger economically because they control commerce. They're not just a danger politically because they selectively control and amplify political discourse. They're an extinction-level, existential danger to humans because they prevent people from seriously considering what kinds of categories are important in each of their lives. They resist their own analysis and over time make people dumber. Right now we're skating through the danger because we're harvesting people from less-advanced countries to do our hard-thinking for us. That window is quickly drawing to a close.
  
- AI isn't a clear and present danger to our species because we're going to end up fighting the robots like in Terminator. AI is a clear and present danger to our species because it might end up doing exactly what some of us want it to do: become a brain extension.
