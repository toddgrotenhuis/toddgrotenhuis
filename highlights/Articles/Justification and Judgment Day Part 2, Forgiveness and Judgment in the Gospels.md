## Highlights
- It's difficult to avoid the conclusion that Jesus preached that we will be judged by our deeds on Judgment Day. Both Jesus and John agree on this point.
  And yet, this is the same Jesus who forgives the woman caught in the act of adultery, touched lepers, welcomed tax collectors like Zacchaeus, and forgave the thief on the cross. Plus, what about the Parable of the Prodigal Son? Or the parable of the Laborers in the Vineyard where those who work an hour get the same pay as those who worked all day? What about Jesus' message of mercy, grace, and forgiveness? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01g3j9ft6bhfeb13w0zqa94m8t))
- Few Christians speak about the whole Jesus. Why? Because the whole Jesus seems like a big paradox. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01g3j9gnhs44n7ckvktehkk52y))
- You can receive grace, but if you fail to pay if forward you'll be judged without mercy. Forgiveness isn't a blank check. Forgiveness just gets you back into the flock, where you renew your covenantal obligation to not act like a wolf ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01g3j9nq4xz2jeywgfas1eq7kb))
