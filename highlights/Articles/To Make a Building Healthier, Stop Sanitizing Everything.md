## Highlights
- Like Pigpen from the comic strip Peanuts, each of us has a plume of microbes spewing off our body at a rate of about 37 million bacteria and 8 billion fungal particles per hour; the difference is that our plumes are invisible to the naked eye. Indoors, the impact is measurable. One study notes that it takes less than 24 hours for a hotel guest to colonize a room with their personal microbes, erasing all traces of previous guests and making the space microbially identical to their home.
- Considering our perpetual emanations, it’s easy to envision how the coronavirus might spread within a room. A single sneeze discharges roughly 30,000 microbe-filled droplets traveling at up to 200 mph. A cough releases about 3,000 droplets, which reach speeds of 50 mph. A simple exhale produces 50 to 5,000 droplets. We know that a person infected with influenza releases as many as 33 viral particles per minute just breathing and about 200 million per sneeze. Meanwhile, exposure to just a few hundred SARS-CoV-2 particles may be enough to cause infection.
- Sunlight also inactivates viruses in as little as five minutes—eight minutes in the case of SARS-CoV-2.
- In hopes of zapping SARS-CoV-2 straight out of the air, some building managers are installing so-called bipolar ionization units, even though they may not work against Covid and sometimes generate harmful gases such as the lung irritant ozone.
- Not only does sufficient moisture in the air allow the human immune system to function at its best, it also causes viral particles to drop to the floor and die more quickly. According to some calculations, viruses in dry air can survive six times as long as those in buildings with a relative humidity of about 40%.
- In London, Los Angeles, Mumbai, and other polluted cities, outdoor air needs to be heavily filtered before being pumped indoors, and most beneficial outdoor microbes likely don’t survive. But in cleaner and greener areas, simply opening windows has proved effective. “After taking antibiotics, you’re supposed to eat yogurt to replenish with probiotics,” says Mark Fretz, a colleague of Van den Wymelenberg at the University of Oregon, where he’s a research assistant professor at the Institute for Health in the Built Environment. “For your buildings, the yogurt is essentially opening your window.”
