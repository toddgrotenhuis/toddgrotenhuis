## Highlights
- Most culinary mushrooms contain similar quantities of the same vitamins and minerals. So buy any varieties that you’ll eat and enjoy. White button, cremini, and portobello are the most widely available and [affordable](https://www.cooksillustrated.com/articles/1442-our-guide-to-fresh-mushrooms). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01g19wps4khye3w612xfd8zdzt))
- **White button:** [About 90% of mushrooms consumed in the U.S. are white buttons](https://www.ars.usda.gov/news-events/news/research-news/2010/researchers-study-benefits-of-white-button-mushrooms/#:~:text=In%20the%20United%20States%2C%20white,colleague%20Dayong%20Wu%2C%20and%20others.). These are small to medium size, mild in flavor, and delicate texture, making them highly versatile. Try them in soups, on pizza, and in omelets. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01g19wrbetfs6txmb3bm8ce443))
- **Cremini (a.k.a. brown button, baby bella):** Creminis are the less mature version of portobello mushrooms. They are light brown and have a more robust, earthier flavor and firmer texture than white button mushrooms. They hold up better in liquids than white buttons, but otherwise, you can use the two interchangeably. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01g19wr6f0fq3psvvwkrd5f3mg))
- **Portobella:** These mushrooms are large (with some portobello caps as big as your palm) and have a richer, somewhat meaty flavor and firm texture that holds up well to marinating and pan-frying or grilling, making them a good meat substitute. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01g19wrrj990v3v7bx9j683edp))
- **Shiitake:** Popular in Asian cuisines, shiitakes have broad, umbrella-shaped brown caps and a robust, woodsy flavor. Fresh shiitakes lend great flavor to stir-fries, while dried shiitakes pack a concentrated umami punch that’s wonderful in soups. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01g19ws5m0ky3e5527qxsnp63r))
- **Maitake:** Also called Hen of the Woods, maitakes are often sold in clusters of brown feathery caps. They have a robust, earthy flavor that’s a bit more delicate than a shiitake, and they’re even slightly peppery (but not hot). Try them in pastas, risottos, and ramen. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01g19wsjx463e2j05k0y5rw4yg))
- **Enoki:** Somewhat alien in appearance, enokis have long, spindly stems topped with tiny, button-shaped caps. They have a mild taste and crunchy texture. They can be quickly sauteed and used to add texture to soups, noodle dishes, and stir-fries. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01g19wsvazfmz8e97sd7c6ehme))
- When shopping for fresh mushrooms, [choose](https://fruitsandveggies.org/fruits-and-veggies/mushrooms/) firm, well-shaped ones free of spots and slime. If possible, inspect the underside of mushrooms—ones with visible gills tend to have [a richer flavor](https://www.mushroomcouncil.com/how-to/select-store-clean/) than less mature mushrooms whose gills aren’t yet exposed. (Opting for loose mushrooms instead of packaged allows for easier inspection.) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01g1a50gw12h3fj0w7g6fygmbm))
- You can store unwashed mushrooms in the refrigerator for [up to a week](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/pmc/articles/PMC8465629/). But they will only last [one to three days](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/pmc/articles/PMC8465629/) at room temp due to their high moisture content, respiration rate, and lack of a protective outer covering. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01g1a52ajs5xwqx8ky059d1t4q))
- Store [loose mushrooms](https://www.cooksillustrated.com/articles/1442-our-guide-to-fresh-mushrooms) in a partially open zip-top bag to promote airflow and allow for the release of their natural gases, which will prolong shelf life. Keep [packaged mushrooms](https://www.cooksillustrated.com/articles/1442-our-guide-to-fresh-mushrooms) in their original containers (designed for breathability). Once opened, rewrap the container with plastic wrap and poke a few holes in the top to allow airflow. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01g1a532h2yt4nrz8n3ze9fzts))
- Before cooking mushrooms, rinse them under cold water ([without soap](https://www.fda.gov/food/buy-store-serve-safe-food/selecting-and-serving-produce-safely#prep)), wiping off any debris or dirt with your fingers or a paper towel. Then pat dry. Though mushrooms are porous, as long as you don’t slice them before washing, they [shouldn’t absorb too much water](https://www.cooksillustrated.com/articles/1442-our-guide-to-fresh-mushrooms). That said, don’t wash mushrooms until you’re ready to use them; otherwise, they [can get slimy](https://www.cooksillustrated.com/features/8349-mushrooms-101-everything-you-need-to-know). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01g1a540rm5gvsb70tgcrbv856))
- If you buy too many mushrooms, you can [sauté them and freeze](https://www.mushroomcouncil.com/how-to/select-store-clean/) them in an airtight container for one month. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01g1a54dm8ef8m05d6rvjnnwnp))
- Most mushroom stems are perfectly okay to eat, [except shiitake stems](https://www.mushroomcouncil.com/how-to/select-store-clean/), which are tough. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01g1a54gyf9tmkp5qcqp683966))
- As a general rule, the darker the variety of mushroom, [the more umami flavor](https://www.mushroomcouncil.org/all-about-mushrooms/umami/) it possesses. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01g1a54wwc9hs6998p1gntw388))
- Sauteing or searing sliced mushrooms in a skillet over medium-high heat with a minimally refined fat (like olive oil, avocado oil, coconut oil, ghee, or grass-fed butter) and some garlic or herbs is the easiest way to get started. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01g1a55jkvsyy8nk2tmhvbc8k2))
- Try [substituting half the ground beef](https://www.mushroomcouncil.com/the-blend/) in your burger patties, taco meat, and meat sauces with finely chopped fresh mushrooms and cooking as you normally would. [Research suggests](https://www.mushroomcouncil.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Flavor-Enhancing-Mushrooms.pdf) this “blending” method can enhance flavor while reducing calorie, fat, and sodium intake. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01g1a56ztmpnrxv3zyfv2v5qbx))
- For a plant-based burger or steak alternative, [marinate and grill](https://www.wellplated.com/grilled-portobello-mushrooms/) whole portobello mushroom caps until caramelized and golden, about 3-4 minutes per side. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01g1a57nnaf59f3hpwvnzb5y9m))
- For optimal flavor and texture, always cook mushrooms before topping your pie. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01g1a58tyfmf43tdayjwksr0yz))
- Toss white button or cremini mushrooms with olive oil, chopped fresh garlic, herbs, salt, and pepper. Cook on a baking sheet at 400° F for about 10 minutes or until browned. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01g1a59qpd2355x9fnsqdar68k))
- For a crunchy, low-carb snack, make [mushroom chips](https://nomnompaleo.com/post/41605570388/whole30-day-27-paleo-chips-including-a-new). Using a sharp knife or mandolin, cut your favorite mushrooms (oyster and portobello work well) into ⅛-inch slices. Brush slices with avocado or olive oil, space evenly on a baking sheet, and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Bake at 300°F for about 45 minutes, or until golden and crispy.
