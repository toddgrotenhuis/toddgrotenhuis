## Highlights
- biodiversity loss, plastic contamination, but also the waste and contamination of drinking water, and the degradation of the world’s soils through industrial agriculture all have the potential to wipe out humanity before the end of this century. Long before the often-invoked rising sea levels would become a core problem for all nations. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01g3d5m7jn7d0wtf456tb5p3b0))
- species diversity and biodiversity are not the same. The latter term is the more comprehensive one. Biodiversity means diversity on three levels: that of species, but also of genetic diversity within a species, and the ecological diversity of habitats, or ecosystem diversity.

- *We breathe, eat and drink nanoplastic particles.* They dissolve from all plastic products, even during their usage phase. However, the biggest sources of plastic contamination of our bodies are synthetic carpets and clothing (whose fibres are either inhaled by us in the home or enter the waterways via the washing machine) and tyre wear from road traffic. Wind and rainwater spread the synthetic fine dust (“particulate matter”) from tyres across the landscape and ultimately over the entire planet.

- Softeners (plasticisers) dissolve from plastic drinking bottles, but mainly with the help of fatty foods inside plastic containers. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01g3d5ypxvr0e2j3t0fzgz4k2d))
- What is to be aimed for is 1) a strong decrease in plastic consumption (contrary to the quasi-religious commandment of perpetual economic growth) and 2) the replacement of common types of plastic with truly biodegradable materials, e.g. made of cellulose. All materials for consumer goods, clothing, carpeting and tyres MUST become biologically and planetarily *compatible in the long term* (I am deliberately avoiding the woolly term “sustainable” here).

- Worldwide, about 14.2 per cent of greenhouse gas emissions come from livestock farming alone (the world’s cars and vans, by contrast, contribute “only” 8 per cent). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01g3e4tdk9kh2ngdnxbfd0dk8p))
- Overall, industrial agriculture is the second largest driver not only of climate disruption but of the destruction of the entire ecosphere of this planet. (The biggest driver is the global overexploitation of “raw materials” such as fossil fuels, minerals, rare Earths). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01g3e4thmxwehpm9fxcvhcjrdr))
- Both the Gulf Stream and the jet stream can reach a “tipping point”. In climatology, this refers to a point of no return, a *permanent irreversible damage*. In the case of the jet stream, this would herald a new era in which Europe, Asia and North America would lose their seasonal weather patterns, and unpredictable weather changes including extreme storms, tornadoes, heat waves and frosts would lead to severe crop failures.

- Amazon [has now lost its function](https://www.nationofchange.org/2021/07/15/biggest-story-in-the-world-right-now-humanity-has-flipped-amazon-from-carbon-sink-to-source/) as a global carbon sink! On the contrary, it now releases more carbon than it can sequester through tree growth. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01g3e51p2bqwh0q39xbj9g339p))
- **Core Principles of Ecocentrism** 
  1 The ecosphere is the center of value for humanity. 
  2 The creativity and productivity of Earth’s ecosystems depend on their integrity. 
  3 The Earth-centered worldview is supported by natural history. 
  4 Ecocentric ethics are grounded in awareness of our place in nature. 
  5 An ecocentric worldview values diversity of ecosystems and cultures. 
  6 Ecocentric ethics support social justice. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01g3e5cpv1b3vnw1g8nezfan46))
