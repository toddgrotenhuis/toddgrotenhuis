## Highlights
- GE was disguising weaknesses in its industrial units by leaning on its financial arm, GE Capital. GE’s subsequent woes offer a warning of the peril of relying on one hugely successful division to subsidise less profitable units elsewhere—as Google does with its advertising business.
- Spinning off YouTube would increase competition in internet advertising—a handy sop to regulators—as well as unlocking value.
- Google’s best way forward is to follow the advice often given to victims of a mid-life crisis: slim down, decide what matters and follow the dream.
