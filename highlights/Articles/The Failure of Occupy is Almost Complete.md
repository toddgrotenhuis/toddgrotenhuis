## Highlights
- Rainbow Oligarchy, diversifying our autocratic elite rather than tearing it down
- And this is what the left-of-center has to wrap its mind around: the biggest impediment to BlackLivesMatter is people who don’t personally oppose BlackLivesMatter. The biggest impediment to BlackLivesMatter and all manner of other liberal social movements is people who are indifferent to them, who wouldn’t get caught dead with a Confederate flag but who do more to set back Black people than any redneck ever has in real, material terms.
