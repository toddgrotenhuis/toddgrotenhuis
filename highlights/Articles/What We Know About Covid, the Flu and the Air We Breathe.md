## Highlights
- It took a long time for air cleaning to be recognized as a powerful tool for reducing the risk of Covid-19 transmission, and it should be embraced more thoroughly during this pandemic and to reduce flu cases. Ventilation and filtration are two proven techniques for physically removing viruses from the air, so that people are exposed to fewer of them.
- Increasing humidity may also be helpful for reducing transmission. The evidence isn’t as strong as for the other tools, but some data show that humidifying the air in the range of 40 to 60 percent — but not higher because that promotes mold growth — could help. In this range, certain flu viruses, the new coronavirus and other viruses don’t survive as well, and our immune response is stronger than when the air is drier. This effect is still not fully understood and should be researched further.
