## Highlights
- In preparing for a conversation about political theology, I doodled up a list of different ways Christian political action gets expressed. I was trying to sketch out a taxonomy and to discern an inner logic to the various choices and expressions. I want to share this sketch in a few posts. First, a clarification. When I describe "Christian political action" I'm describing the nature of the political engagement, not the content or aims of the political action. Specifically, I'm describing how Christians relate to politics itself, and mainly how we relate to the state. Thus the contrasts here won't be between, say, "progressive" or "evangelical" political action, as those are about different political aims. In the taxonomy I'm sharing both progressives and evangelicals could, in fact, demonstrate the exact same form of political engagement (like winning elections) though with different aims and political goals. That clarification out of the way, let's begin. The taxonomy I'm proposing starts with what I think is the key question at the heart of political theology. Specifically, are Christians responsible for the outcome of history? This question comes from John Howard Yoder, and I think it's the first and largest fork in the road for Christian political engagement, for it defines how the Christian will view and relate to the state. Christians who answer "yes" to the question of historical responsibility believe that Christians are politically responsible for righting the injustices of the world. Consequently, Christians must avail themselves of political power to bend the moral arc of history. Christians are obligated to be politically involved and engaged. Christians who answer "no" to the question of historical responsibility view politics, this side of the eschaton, as fallen and therefore corrupting to the moral witness of the church. Consequently, Christians cannot participate in politics as involvement in politics so eclipses, blurs, corrupts, distorts, compromises, and erases the Christian moral witness that kingdom of God is no longer visible in the world, as either prophetic moral contrast or eschatological hope. Christians, therefore, are not responsible for the outcome of history, not obligated to assume control of the state to right wrongs. Christians are called, rather, to bear witness to the kingdom of God as an "eschatological community of political contrast" within history. Christian political witness is to create a "colony of heaven" in the midst of history as a contrasting vision of community and power over against the state
