## Highlights
- Going with the warehouse analogy a bit more, your goal is to maintain a flow of inventory through the warehouse - to get high velocity across your Find Risk → Fix Risk flow.
- Bottom line: drive a greater velocity in your Find Risk → Fix Risk flow. Actively manage your Risk Inventory and continuously examine that inventory across multiple triggers. Systemize these triggers as much as possible. Tune this machine constantly - like you would a manufacturing inventory process.
