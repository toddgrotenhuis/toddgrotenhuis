## Highlights
- *Akkermansia muciniphila* lives in your large intestine. First documented in 2004, [*A. muciniphila*](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6163243/) survives off mucin (proteins that makeup mucus)––which helps protect our gut lining.
  **How it impacts metabolic health:** *A. muciniphila* functions as a probiotic by living off one energy source (mucin) and producing several molecules that maintain a healthy gut microbiome.
  Having more beneficial bacteria helps regulate the thickness of your intestinal lining and improves glucose control ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01fy2k8gn9ksjz18315pt8cddr))
- If you’re looking to promote *A. muciniphila* in your system, avoiding a high-fat diet and heavy drinking may help ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01fy2kab49gg1xnn2n7ydczn1g))
- Foods that can increase the abundance of [this strain](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4856456/) include cranberries, grapes, and tea. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01fy2kbd6e73tf769h1srmj4z7))
- *Clostridium butyricum* is a bacterial species first found in pig intestines back in 1880. It’s named for the high amounts of butyrate it makes, which we’ll dig into below. Interestingly, [*C. butyricum* can act](https://www.clinicalmicrobiologyandinfection.com/article/S1198-743X(15)00914-3/fulltext) as both a probiotic and a pathogen in the body; in some cases, it produces toxins that can cause life-threatening diseases in humans and animals. But this is rare and occurs only in isolated instances ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01fy2kcyv19j0y8q55ccwvy1z4))
- It produces a substance called butyrate, which your GI system uses as an energy source. Butyrate, a short-chain fatty acid (SCFA), results from the fermentation of dietary fibers by bacteria in the body. SCFAs like butyrate contribute an [estimated 60-70% of energy](https://academic.oup.com/advances/article/9/1/21/4849000) needed by cells lining the colon, making it crucial for metabolic health. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01fy2kdpz9xf1hj8arvagw37x0))
- *C. butyricum* is found in certain foods, but probably not ones you want to eat (like sour milk). It’s [naturally found](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/19490976.2021.1907272) in things like vegetables, cheese, and cultured milk. It’s also found naturally in soil. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01fy2kf9nt9mbg6tv73hn9t4gr))
- Also a butyrate producer, *Anaerobutyricum hallii* is a common microbe that helps control glucose and maintain stability and balance within your intestinal tract. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01fy2kgegmbdzv1n926mgjhabv))
- *A. halli* is thought to work by replenishing the body’s butyrate supply. It does this by [absorbing and breaking down](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/pmc/articles/PMC4871866/) acetate, lactate, and glucose. As this happens, fermentation occurs, which creates butyrate and hydrogen as final products. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01fy2kjfke9cvt8n143kt6mwg8))
- Plant-based foods and those high in fiber, such as whole grains, beans, and artichokes, promote *A. halli*. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01fy3530y9xa9j5e70t10nhanb))
- [*B. infantis*](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7352178/) is part of a family of bacteria isolated more than a century ago. As the name suggests, this bacteria is plentiful in infants and is passed down from mother to baby. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01fy3540x43ydpvcwtx0fc9h2z))
- Once this beneficial bacteria colonize a baby’s GI tract, it plays an essential role in developing immunity and reducing inflammation. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01fy354thzygjzthrk5554005h))
- [Studies have found](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7769758/) psoriasis and obesity are linked, despite being completely different conditions. People with psoriasis have a significantly higher risk of obesity, and obesity is also a risk factor for psoriasis ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01fy355k3q4wb6vn6dy54e54k9))
- *B. infantis* is [from foods](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5435742/) (especially fermented ones), including cheeses, yogurt, sauerkraut, and other dairy products. It’s also available as a supplement. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01fy3574j3ckra47cgrryxcyzs))
