## Highlights
- When anaphylaxis was asked to return to the Cornerstone Festival to play the “Industrial Stage” opening for Audio Paradox and Sanctum, I pulled together a large band including Orlando Greenhill (Havalina Rail Co.) on vocals, Jason Hevener (Signalbleed) on microcassette player and effects pedals, Andrew Latham (Mayfairgrin) on guitar, Andrew Powell (Lackthrow) doing “amp noise” and my then-fiancee Christine playing my Hello Kitty optical theremin. I “conducted” and played my custom-built Hello Kitty pitch theremin. I had built both theremins from kits made by Chuck Collins and used them at nearly every performance after this one. This performance was hugely loud and really, really fun. I was also asked to perform as a member of the White Trash, Inc. Orchestra that year, so that was another dream fulfilled.
    - Note: I remember this! A great evening. I think a bunch of us went to Sanctuary later and talked about this show and then all the Klay Scott/Albert sphere of bands, too. (maybe that latter part was another night)
