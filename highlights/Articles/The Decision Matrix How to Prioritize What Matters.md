## Highlights
- I separated decisions into four possibilities based on the type of decision I was making.
  Irreversible and inconsequential
  Irreversible and consequential
  Reversible and inconsequential
  Reversible and consequential
- I delegated both types of inconsequential decisions. Inconsequential decisions are the perfect training ground to develop judgment.
- Reversible and consequential decisions are my favorite. These decisions trick you into thinking they are one big important decision. In reality, reversible and consequential decisions are the perfect decisions to run experiments and gather information.
- Consequential and irreversible decisions are the ones that you really need to focus on.
- I also had another rule that proved helpful: unless the decision needed to be made on the spot, as some operational decisions do, I would take a 30-minute walk first.
