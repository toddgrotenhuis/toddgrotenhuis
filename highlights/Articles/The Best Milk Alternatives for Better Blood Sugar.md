## Highlights
- Some dairy prompts your body to release far more insulin than would be expected given its glycemic index (its sugars are mostly lactose, not glucose). But research is conflicted about [what effect this ultimately has on metabolic health](https://www.levelshealth.com/blog/what-we-know-about-dairy-and-blood-sugar). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01g3d3n6tvq1f1sp10mjtja3xr))
- About 36% of Americans have [lactose malabsorption](https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/digestive-diseases/lactose-intolerance/definition-facts#common), which can cause lactose intolerance and an upset GI system if they consume anything containing lactose. Cutting dairy from their diet is an easy way to eliminate this sometimes painful situation. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01g3d3qegvyh9r0w12hjpbf93p))
- undesirable side effects when they consume the dairy proteins, including [congestion](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19932941/) and [acne](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29778512/). It’s unclear exactly why this is. One theory is that dairy can trigger inflammation in the body, which can lead to [nasal congestion](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19932941/). Other research suggests that consuming dairy [increases levels of the hormone insulin-like growth factor 1](https://sci-hub.se/10.1016/j.clnu.2018.04.015) (IGF-1), in turn [increasing the production of sebum](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19709092/) (a.k.a. oil). Too much sebum can clog pores, resulting in pimples. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01g3d3r72z3ssbgnfyk3118ws4))
- **Carrageenan:** Some brands add this extract from red seaweed to thicken and stabilize plant-based milks. However, some research links carrageenan to [gastrointestinal inflammation](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8539934/), which may lead to inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) or trigger flare-ups for those who have an IBD.

- if you have a lot of GI symptoms, you may find that milk alternatives made without gums (such as gellan gum or locust bean gum) sit best with your system. Although these ingredients are considered safe, they can be difficult to digest—and that can cause a lot of discomfort if you have compromised gut health ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01g3d3stzpetw0dwyrhpdhdzqn))
- **Almond milk:** The fat in almond milk is predominantly [monounsaturated fat](https://www.levelshealth.com/blog/8-micronutrients-essential-for-metabolic-health). Eating more of this fat and less carbohydrates or saturated fat may [help control blood sugar and improve insulin resistance](https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1002087). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01g3d3w82ann9kcrssxkkzzyb0))
- **Cashew milk:** Like almond milk, cashew milk tends to be [low in calories](https://silk.com/plant-based-products/cashewmilk/unsweetened-cashewmilk/) and rich in [monounsaturated fats](https://elmhurst1925.com/products/unsweetened-milked-cashews). Yet it’s thicker and creamier than almond milk ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01g3d3wxtrw3nyzp51x7dh64qc))
- **Hemp milk:** An option for people with nut allergies, hemp milk provides 2-3 grams of protein, a dose of heart-healthy unsaturated fatty acids, and [omega 3s](https://livingharvest.com/#ingredients) in every cup. It does tend to be an acquired taste, though—some find it a bit “grassy.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01g3d3xe8z5xazmkw02hm8v67g))
- A cup of coconut milk here and there is fine for most people, but too much of any source of saturated fat may be [associated with decreased insulin sensitivity](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/312599438_Acute_dietary_fat_intake_initiates_alterations_in_energy_metabolism_and_insulin_resistance) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01g3d3yqzesxjq035a3s0tsm5k))
- Flax is a source of anti-inflammatory [omega-3 fatty acids](https://www.levelshealth.com/blog/why-omega-3s-are-crucial-to-strong-metabolic-health) and is an option for those with nut allergies ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01g3d40rfcg5w1v1deqtqkeqjb))
