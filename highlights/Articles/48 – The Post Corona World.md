## Highlights
- Reality shows suddenly seemed awkward and the whole trivia trash, the garbage for the soul that flowed through all channels seemed ridiculous.
- The Corona crisis made it clear that those who want to incite people against each other have nothing to contribute to real questions about the future.
- This process of complexation — not to be confused with COMPLICATION — can also be consciously designed by people. Those who can, who speak the language of the coming complexity, will be the leaders of tomorrow.

- Human civilisation has become too dense, too fast, and overheated.
