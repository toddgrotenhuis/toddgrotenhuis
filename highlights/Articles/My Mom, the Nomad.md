## Highlights
- The people who not only lived in vans but also participated in the vandwelling culture mostly fit a consistent demographic type. They were, by and large, former members of the middle class. They were overwhelmingly white, had an affinity for camping, and could travel in rural parts of the country without fear.

- Writing in The Guardian, Xan Brooks called the film an “anti-Western,” one that engages with the cinematic genre only to reveal its shortcomings. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1410610481/16527761))
- the film briefly gestures at our cultural fascination with the nomads, and the way they dramatize the tension between “freedom” and dispossession. Has Fern rejected a middle-class life, or was she cut out of one? ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1410610481/16527831))
