## Highlights
- Konjac noodles
  Also known as shirataki noodles, this pasta swap comes from the root of konjac, a vegetable found mainly in Asia. Their main carbohydrate is glucomannan fiber, a highly viscous soluble fiber—konjac noodles are mostly water (and come packaged wet in the refrigerated section). This fiber slows down digestion, which helps blunt any blood-sugar spike. Because of its slow digestion, glucomannan also feeds the good bacteria in your colon so they can produce short-chain fatty acids that reduce inflammation and stimulate the release of the gut satiety hormone peptide YY.

- (If you see tofu shirataki noodles, it just means there’s added tofu, but this is unlikely to change its glycemic response.) ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1430062325/16988962))
- Best way to use them: Because of their high water content, these noodles feel slightly slimy. They also have a pretty pungent smell straight from the bag, so rinse well before eating. The texture can be a little strange in Italian-style pasta dishes, so you might want to try them in Asian noodle recipes that call for rich sauces and lots of other vegetable add-ins ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1430062325/16988971))
- Best way to use them: You’ll notice a slightly lemony, artichoke-like taste to this pasta alternative (which dissipates a little after soaking and rinsing). So it works well in lemon- and garlic-forward Mediterranean dishes. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1430062325/16988977))
- Chickpea pasta will give you the most fiber at 13g per serving compared to ~3g for regular, lentil, and brown rice pasta. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1430062325/16988981))
