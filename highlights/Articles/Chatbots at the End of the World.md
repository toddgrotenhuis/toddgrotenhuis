## Highlights
- These days, flashy Silicon Valley technology developments often seem completely at odds with what is going on in the world.
- And increasingly, it seems as though the direction Silicon Valley has taken does not line up with the future most of us are anticipating.
- But since the coronavirus triggered mass unemployment, forcing over forty million Americans to file for unemployment benefits since the crisis began, many of those with scarce resources have reacted by building mutual aid networks to assist others in their community.
- The exclusivity and obscene wealth of this cohort shapes their perception of what the public good looks like, which may not align with the opinions of, say, a medical professional or a public school teacher.
- The ridiculousness of pitching the solution to one planet becoming uninhabitable as moving to another, probably more uninhabitable planet, is obvious, but it fits into a pernicious historical narrative about how progress has been achieved.
- moving to new lands and colonizing them has always been beneficial to the advancement of people of a certain class and race.
- The motivation to work toward mitigating disaster is minimal for those with the most power to do so.
