## Highlights
- But in many ways the GOP is now facing an existential crisis. It relies on counter-majoritarian institutions and strategies, whether it’s the Electoral College, the courts, voter suppression, and gerrymandering, to win national elections.

- we have been largely inured or habituated to what I would call the macro-aggressions we are now subjected to: extreme wealth polarization, declining living standards, declining life expectancy, heavy surveillance, substantial erosions of our capacities to ensure collective flourishing.

- The upsurge of trainings around sexual harassment or around white privilege are examples of these controlling tendencies and administrative approaches, and I don’t think they can attain the goals that they set (i.e., social justice), because they suffer from an elite skew.

- We’re sort of caught between a type of progressive conformism on the one hand, one that speaks a language of inclusion and diversity, and on the other hand, a reckless right-wing vision of freedom, understood as the impunity to do whatever you want under terms of protected wealth and status, damn the consequences.

- I think that some of the progressive discourses of harm management use minor harms to assert power rather than to achieve justice or restitution, let alone to contribute to something that I would call collective flourishing. At the same time, what I am calling the elite skew that frames a logic of cancellation actually means that macro-aggressions mostly go unpunished. The well-heeled perpetrators — those most responsible for big risk and big ruin, like war and financial crisis — fail upwards. Meanwhile, smaller players face personal ruin and disproportionate punishment for small risks, badly taken. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1384555317/15430626))
- There’s not going to be a simple restoration of American international leadership, and the United States is going to have to figure out how to play well with others, while focusing on the immense challenges of domestic reform. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1384555317/15430668))
- “The 1619 Project” also gives limited scope to what may have been the more important reason that the American Revolution was fought: land hunger. The settler colonial aspect is a crucial part of the story that we need to tell if we’re going to understand not only the founding but also the tributaries of that founding into the present — questions of expansion, militarism, the place of the United States in the world, where our borders begin and where they end.

- The American founders believed “extending the sphere,” as James Madison put it, was the key to democracy because it would allow individual men, small-holders, to make their fortunes without forming destabilizing factions that would challenge the prerogatives of concentrated wealth and power.
