## Highlights
- Well, it's hard to see how we can get to a 100% worry-free situation with texts like "work out your own salvation with fear and trembling" hanging around, along with all the other warnings about falling away. Warnings imply some worry. But a bit of worry might not be such a bad thing. Frankly, given the bad behavior of so many Christians, I think we need some more worry in the pews, a few more sermons on Sunday proclaiming "the fire will test what sort of work each of us has done."
  However, as noted early in this series, worry can be a pastoral problem. Especially if you think you're doing this all alone. But this is why what we said at the start of this post is so important: You're not alone. We will be able to stand because *God* will make us stand ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01g3ja57vzhg6075z2zv3277wv))
