## Highlights
- Mushrooms are noted for their characteristic flavor when cooked; they provide a savory, meaty umami taste to dishes. That’s because they are an excellent source of both glutamic acid and the nucleotides IMP and GMP, which combine to produce a strong umami taste. Since both glutamic acid and the nucleotides are nonvolatile and heat-stable, cooking does not destroy mushrooms’ ability to enhance the taste of food.

- Shopping Tips for Mushrooms
  We recommend buying loose rather than packaged mushrooms so you can inspect their condition. 
  Pay attention to the following qualities:
  **Cap Size and Condition:** Whole and intact with no discoloration or dry, shriveled patches. Pick mushrooms with large caps and minimal stems.
  **Moisture:** Faintly damp but not moist or slimy.
  **Texture:** Springy and light—never spongy.
  **Aroma:** Intensely sweet and earthy. Avoid mushrooms that smell sour or fishy. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01g52bq02j0ghw11ybw2v7904h))
- How to Store Mushrooms
  Maximizing the shelf life of mushrooms is all about balancing air circulation with moisture retention.
  **Loose Mushrooms:** Store in a partially open zipper-lock bag, which maximizes air circulation without drying them out. Leaving the bag slightly open allows ethylene gas emitted from the mushrooms to be released, prolonging their shelf life.
  **Packaged Mushrooms:** Store in their original containers, which are designed to “breathe,” maximizing the mushrooms’ shelf life by balancing the retention of moisture and the release of ethylene gas. If you open a sealed package of mushrooms but don’t use all the contents, rewrap the remaining contents in the box with plastic wrap and poke a few holes in the plastic wrap to allow moisture to escape.
  **DON’T** wrap mushrooms in a paper bag or cover them with a damp paper towel, as many sources suggest. Both techniques speed up their deterioration. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01g52brz082zka757mzaby5nse))
- **How to Know When Mushrooms Go Bad 
  **A slimy film on the cap and stem, mushy texture, and dark discoloration are the classic indicators of spoiled mushrooms. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01g52bsct1qwrj781tgrx35qxn))
- Mushrooms with exposed gills (such as portobello and shiitake) absorbed lots of water, so it’s best to avoid washing these varieties. Instead, simply brush off any dirt with a [pastry brush](https://www.cooksillustrated.com/equipment_reviews/1889-pastry-brushes) or [paper towel](https://www.cooksillustrated.com/equipment_reviews/1802-paper-towels). But varieties that don’t contain exposed gills didn’t soak up much water at all, so it’s fine to wash them as long as you do so before cutting them; their exposed flesh will absorb water like a sponge. (Note: Most cultivated mushrooms are very clean and don’t require washing in the first place.) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01g52btwfd7zgdry4jk89xx1k4))
