## Highlights
- For example, he and his colleagues distinguished between forgiveness and condoning, excusing or overlooking an offence. For true forgiveness to occur, they asserted, there needed to be a true offence or hurt, with real consequences.
- Denying their own pain or overlooking the atrocity would not be forgiveness. And, if it came, forgiveness would occur only after working through that hard reality of what had happened.
- forgiveness doesn’t necessarily include reconciliation but is the internal process by which someone resolves bitterness and hurt, and moves to something more positive toward the offending person, such as empathy or love. In contrast, reconciliation is a process through which people re-establish a trusting relationship with someone who hurt them. This distinction became foundational in my own healing.
- By seeing forgiveness as a separate process from reconciliation, new options appeared.
- Over and over again in our forgiveness programmes, participants tell us that one of the most important and effective parts is the opportunity to share with others what happened to them. They have said that the most helpful part was ‘knowing that others had similar struggles’, and ‘being able to vent – we could talk about things I couldn’t elsewhere’, and ‘That I felt listened to, really understood, and that I could get this off of my chest.’
- There is great power in empathising, as there is great potential for harm.
  
- It can lead to a broader view of the events that make the offence less about an evil person delighting in hurting them, and more about a complex situation in which someone made hurtful or bad decisions. This perspective-taking and understanding can open the door for forgiveness.
- Of course, if done poorly or without boundaries, trying to develop empathy can be nothing more than blaming the victim and encouraging those who have been hurt to question or minimise their feelings or allow others to hurt them in the future. The important and difficult part of this process is in helping people to hold both the legitimacy of their pain while exploring other points of view. The goal is to help people to embrace their feelings as understandable and their reactions as justified, even while they gain an appreciation for the offending person’s perspective.
- The general approach of our intervention is to help people take appropriate amounts of responsibility for the offence or hurt, identifying ways in which they are culpable for the other person’s pain. Out of this responsibility, they are encouraged to identify and express the remorse they feel. We believe it’s healthy to embrace our guilt and to place that feeling in a realistic context. From this point, it is then possible to move toward restoration. In this step, the person is encouraged to make amends, to restore damage done to others and their relationships, and to recommit to values or standards that they might have violated when hurting others. Finally, the person is able to move into renewal, which we understand to be a replacement of guilt and self-condemnation with renewed self-respect and self-compassion. This renewal is appropriate only after a true accounting of the offence. But once that has been done, we believe it’s beneficial for the person to move into a renewed sense of self-acceptance and forgiveness.
