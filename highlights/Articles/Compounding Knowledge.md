## Highlights
- While most of us focus on consuming information that we won’t care about next month, let alone next year, Buffett focused on knowledge and companies that change very, very slowly or not at all.
- Here are a few telltale signs you’re dealing with expiring information. First, it’s marketed to you. Second, lacking details and nuance, it’s easily digestible. This is why it’s commonly telling you what happened, not why it happened or under what conditions it might happen again. Third, it won’t be relevant in a month or a year.
- Will you care about what your reading in a month? In a year? In five years?
- Are you focused enough on the same thing to build cumulative knowledge or are you too spread out?

- What do you spend time on that’s likely to change in the next few years? What’s not likely to change?
