## Highlights
- The question we need to ask is not whether our data is safe, but why there is suddenly so much of it that needs protecting. The problem with the dragon, after all, is not its stockpile stewardship, but its appetite.
- I’ll call it ‘ambient privacy’—the understanding that there is value in having our everyday interactions with one another remain outside the reach of monitoring, and that the small details of our daily lives should pass by unremembered
- Authoritarian states like China and Saudi Arabia are using this newfound capacity as a tool of social control. Here in the United States, we’re using it to show ads.
- Ambient privacy is not a property of people, or of their data, but of the world around us.
- Just like you can’t drop out of the oil economy by refusing to drive a car, you can’t opt out of the surveillance economy by forswearing technology (and for many people, that choice is not an option)
- Because our laws frame privacy as an individual right, we don’t have a mechanism for deciding whether we want to live in a surveillance society. 
- Confronted with the reality of a monitored world, people make the rational decision to make the best of it. 
  That is not consent.
- When all discussion takes place under the eye of software, in a for-profit medium working to shape the participants’ behavior, it may not be possible to create the consensus and shared sense of reality that is a prerequisite for self-government.
- The infrastructure of mass surveillance is too complex, and the tech oligopoly too powerful, to make it meaningful to talk about individual consent.
- What does it mean to be manipulated from an early age by machine learning algorithms that adaptively learn to shape our behavior?
- They correctly see the new round of privacy laws as a weapon to deploy against smaller rivals, further consolidating their control over the algorithmic panopticon.
