## Highlights
- Christian politics then, rather than being an in-breaking reality of counter-ethics to imperial and hegemonic tendencies, have opted into imperial political life, and therefore have nothing more to offer society than what is already offered among gifted intellectuals in fields like sociology and philosophy.
- I began to see America not as the innocent hand of God in the world but as one aligned with the portrayals, offered by Israelite witnesses, of Egypt, Babylon, Assyria, and Rome at the peaks of their oppressive empires.
- I am one who interprets Constantine’s work in the 4th century as a defining shift for the Western church, in which Christians moved from persevering through persecution to performing persecution. Many aspects, though not all, of the church’s understanding of its role in the world were compromised by its new vision of Christianizing society from the top down.
- In Anabaptist terms, one’s Gelassenheit, or ‘yieldedness’ to the life of Jesus, is the goal. There is a constant transition from exegeting ‘The Word’ in Scripture, which is ultimately Jesus, and following ‘The Way’ in one’s own life, which is also Jesus.
- The incarnational life is a scandalized life. It is a threat to the powers, it is problematic, and it is punishable. The incarnational life is not a friend of empire; rather empire tries to take control of all representations of such life, by either distortion or domestication.
- Therefore the incarnational life has more to do with perseverance in following than perfection in attainment.
