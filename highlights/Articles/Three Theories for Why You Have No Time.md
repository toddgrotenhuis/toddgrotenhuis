## Highlights
- Better technology means higher expectations—and higher expectations create more work.
- In the 1950s, a British civil servant coined the term Parkinson’s Law to explain the phenomenon that “work expands to fill the available time.”
- A lot of modern overwork is class and status maintenance—for this generation and the next.
- Technology only frees people from work if the boss—or the government, or the economic system—allows it.
- Americans tend to use new productivity and technology to buy a better life rather than to enjoy more downtime in inferior conditions. And when material concerns are mostly met, Americans fixate on their status and class, and that of their children, and work tirelessly to preserve and grow it.
- To solve the problems of overwork and time starvation, we have to recognize both that individuals have the agency to make small changes to improve their lives and that, without broader changes to our laws and norms and social expectations, no amount of overwork will ever be enough.
