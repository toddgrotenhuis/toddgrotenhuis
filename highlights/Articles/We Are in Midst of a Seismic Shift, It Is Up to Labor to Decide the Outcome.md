## Highlights
- All three of them have independently reached similar conclusions, that the price signal under capitalist markets will eventually wither away to some more complex decision making for coordination. However, they diverge on what it would be replaced by, from a strong welfare state to socialist planned economy, or barter and local currency exchange.
- To show how things can head in the wrong direction, the original New Deal created the social safety net, which today translates to a stock market being two thirds owned by pensions, so the workers have ‘won’ by being the legal owner of the means of production, but as a result of structural layers across the economy, they still function as a property-less class when it comes to negotiating with their employer, and financial institutions use their own pensions as leverage against them and to the benefit of minority investors in a housing crises.
