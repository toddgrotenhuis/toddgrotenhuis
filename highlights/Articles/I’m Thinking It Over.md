## Highlights
- I don’t have to speak about things I know little or nothing about.
- If I can bring to an issue heat, but no light, it is probably best that I remain silent.
- Delayed communication, made when people have had time to think and to calm their emotions, is almost always more valuable than immediate reaction.
- Some conversations are be more meaningful and effective in living rooms, or at dinner tables, than in the middle of Main Street.
