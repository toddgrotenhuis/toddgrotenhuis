## Highlights
- Here are some goals we can construct from Wollstonecraft’s approach to travel:
  Try to actively know the place you are in. Observe the customs. Interact with the locals.
  Learn the whys behind the observation. Explore the history. Ask questions. Try to understand the answers in relation to what you are experiencing now, setting aside any previous assumptions.
  Notice how the journey is affecting you. What memories surface? What new insights do you have? Are your opinions and beliefs challenged?
  Don’t plan out every detail. Explore. The map is not the territory.
- Try these specific tips to apply this mental models approach to travel:
  Keep a travel journal. It doesn’t have to be complicated. Travel is full of idle moments like waiting for transportation, or museum-feet recovery at the end of the day. Reflect and capture.
  Encourage serendipity in your experiences. Give yourself the chance to experience the unexpected. Over-planning reinforces your current biases. You can’t possibly know the best of a place before you get there.
  Be deliberate in setting your goal. Go somewhere with the intent of gaining something out of that experience. Don’t try to recreate your life at home, with the same restaurants and television shows.
  Be open to growth. Travel is an opportunity to choose to be different. Anticipate that you might add to the construct that is “you” when you travel. Embrace the additions to your identity so that you have new resources to draw on.
