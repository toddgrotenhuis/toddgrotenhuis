## Highlights
- It became obvious to me that the perpetuation of these Black deaths weren’t to save Black people or to make Black people aware, but to shock or engage White people.
- How can a Black person tell if the White person is at a protest to resist the imperialist white supremacist capitalist patriarchy, or to simply consume Black tragedy porn when videos on Facebook no longer pack the same punch?
- White people shouldn’t be allies, but on the front lines with disenfranchised people to deconstruct tyranny.
- White people should not be capturing Black trauma with cameras for a newspaper, but using those same cameras to expose the evil of White supremacy.
