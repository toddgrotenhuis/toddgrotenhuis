## Highlights
- caffeine seems to impair insulin’s effectiveness. Research has shown that insulin sensitivity drops in response to a single dose of caffeine following 72 hours of caffeine avoidance. It also drops after high coffee consumption over four weeks, suggesting the body does not build a tolerance to caffeine’s effect on insulin over time.
- There’s increasing evidence that genetics play a role in how different people process caffeine, too. Researchers refer to “fast metabolizers” and “slow metabolizers,” who show differences in how caffeine affects their glucose and insulin levels. A study published at the end of 2020 looked at the effects of caffeine energy shot drinks in adolescents. It found that not only did the drinks disrupt teens’ glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity, there were also significant differences among the subjects that seemed to correlate with genetic differences. Those who metabolized caffeine the quickest had the poorest glucose and insulin responses. Earlier research theorized that people who clear caffeine rapidly never get a chance to build their caffeine tolerance, but there’s still no consensus on whether people even can build a tolerance to all of caffeine’s effects in the body.
- But why does caffeine impair glucose metabolism? Caffeine stimulates the central nervous system by blocking the action of adenosine, a metabolite that helps regulate our energy levels.
- The reason adenosine affects glucose is that in addition to the brain, there are adenosine receptors throughout the body, including in adipose (fat) tissue and muscle tissue—both sites where insulin facilitates glucose uptake—as well as in the liver, which controls the production of glucose and release of stored glucose. Scientists still aren’t precisely sure which adenosine receptors play the most crucial role in modifying glucose uptake and insulin sensitivity. But a recent animal study suggests its effect on muscle tissue uptake exerts the most significant influence. Either way, multiple studies demonstrate that restricting the action of adenosine, as caffeine has been shown to do, decreases insulin sensitivity.
- Caffeine also increases the amount of epinephrine (aka adrenaline) circulating in the blood, which accounts for part of the energy boost you feel after imbibing. Epinephrine is also known to cause insulin resistance, impair glucose control, and trigger glucose production. However, studies have shown that in the small amounts triggered by caffeine, epinephrine’s impact on glucose is probably too low to be responsible for caffeine’s effects.
- One study, which followed nearly 1900 adult men and women for a median duration of 5.8 years, found that adults who consumed at least one cup of coffee per week had a 22% lower risk for prediabetes and 34% risk reduction for Type 2 diabetes compared to people who didn’t drink coffee. Another study, which followed around 88,000 women in the US with no history of diabetes, found that both regular and decaf coffee consumption for eight years seemed to lower the risk of developing Type 2 diabetes, with regular coffee offering a slight edge over decaf. Drinking more cups was associated with lower risk—women who drank one cup per day saw a 13% reduction in relative risk, while women who drank four or more cups saw a 47% reduction.
  That decaf demonstrates nearly the same benefits as regular coffee suggests that something other than caffeine is driving the protective effect. The most likely candidate is chlorogenic acids, members of a group of antioxidant-rich micronutrients called polyphenols, abundant in plant-based foods.
- Not a coffee fan? A 2020 meta-analysis found that taking a supplement with 400 mg or more of green coffee bean extract positively affected both fasting blood sugar and insulin levels.
- If caffeine is part of your current routine, either in your morning coffee or before a workout, be aware that it is likely decreasing your acute insulin sensitivity. Try not to pair it with high-carb meals.
- If you’re not a coffee person, don’t start drinking coffee just for the long-term metabolic benefits. You can get the same beneficial chlorogenic acids through several fruits and vegetables, including apples, artichokes, carrots, and tomatoes. Drinking green tea also appears to have long-term positive effects.
