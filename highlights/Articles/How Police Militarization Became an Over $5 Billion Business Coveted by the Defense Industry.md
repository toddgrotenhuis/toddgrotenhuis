## Highlights
- Many of this militarized equipment is transferred through two federal programs: the 1033 and the 1122 initiatives. The 1122 program allows the police to purchase new military equipment using their own funding with the same discounts enjoyed by the federal government. The 1033 program allows the Department of Defense to transfer excess military equipment to local law enforcement agencies free of charge, as long as they pay for shipping and maintenance.
- Since its inception, more than 11,500 domestic law enforcement agencies have taken part in the 1033 program, receiving more than $7.4 billion in military equipment.
- this is really about creating a new market for defense contractors rather than really putting questions of public safety first," said Alex Vitale, the Policing and Social Justice Project Coordinator at Brooklyn College.
- What makes both 1033 and 1122 programs so powerful is the apparent lack of clear oversight and accountability. The 1122 program, for instance, is not a grant or transfer program and thus is not required to be monitored by the federal government. 
- In some cases, equipment transferred through these programs has simply vanished due to what appears to be a lack of oversight and poor bookkeeping.
- the militarization of local police forces might be what's distracting them from their original purpose — protecting our communities.
