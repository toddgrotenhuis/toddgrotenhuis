## Highlights
- No one ever goes down the rabbit hole of dispensational Bible study to return with the message, "I've worked the timeline out, and here's what I found: Nothing will happen in our lifetime." End times belief is always, if not ego-centric, then generation-centric. Dispensationalism trades on calendrical narcissism. Generation after generation of dispensationalists always come to the conclusion that the end times is happening in their very own generation, never in some later, future generation. And the reason for this is heroism. The gas that makes the end times engine run is the heroic notion that you, yes you, are living in the end times, the season of heroic action. Everyone is blind, but you see.
