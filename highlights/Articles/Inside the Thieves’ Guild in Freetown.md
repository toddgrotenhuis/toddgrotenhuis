## Highlights
- “Nobody else was going to help us, so we decided to support ourselves,” explains Isha Turay, the chairwoman. The money she collects each week goes into a communal pot. Members can dip into it in an emergency, such as needing to pay a hospital bill or bury a relative. Anyone who abuses the system is immediately thrown out.
- When officials are predatory, people turn to their communities for protection.
