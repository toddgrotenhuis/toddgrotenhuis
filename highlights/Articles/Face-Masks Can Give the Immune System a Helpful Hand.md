## Highlights
- One vital factor which predicts disease severity is how far viral particles make it into a person's lungs. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1393034725/15721993))
- One of the body’s first lines of defence against airborne pathogens is known as the “mucociliary clearance mechanism”. Sticky mucus in the nose and respiratory tract snares viruses and bacteria. Little hairs known as cilia push the mucus into the throat. From there it is swallowed and potent stomach acids destroy the invaders. But this mechanism relies on the relevant body parts staying moist.
  That is harder in winter, for as air gets colder, its capacity to hold water falls. Lower humidity tends to dry out the respiratory tract. This is one reason why many upper-respiratory viruses, such as influenza, flourish in the winter. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1393034725/15721996))
- masks may help keep things damp. They reasoned that, as a person exhales, water vapour would condense on the inside of a mask. Then, upon inhalation, dry air passing through the mask would collect the deposited water and bring it back into the respiratory tract and lungs. That could be handing a mask-wearer's immune system a significant advantage. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1393034725/15722000))
