## Highlights
- if you’re not sure how you’ll maintain accountability for your remote teams, consider this: how do you keep your teams accountable now?
  If you think it’s by seeing the tops of their heads sticking up out of their cubicles, you may need to reconsider more than your policy on remote work. In the end, you have to be able to measure the results - the output of what you and your employees do, and not just the input in the form of hours spent in a certain chair.
  
- Peer one-on-ones: This involves creating a system that matches 2 of your employees randomly to have a chat and get to know each other better. The idea is to get every member of your team to meet and foster engagement among your workforce. I will recommend that this must be implemented if it’s a fully remote company.
- As an individual contributor, is there something you just did that you think a colleague would have to do at some point in the future, would this have been easier and faster if you had a document to consult?

- You should also share the link in your instant communication channel so your colleagues are aware.
  
- My rule of thumb is, if at least 2 - 3 people on your team have asked you about the how or why of something more than once, and the answer is almost always the same (or there are a few options based on certain conditions), that’s a candidate of a process that needs to be documented. So, the next time you’re asked, you can just forward a link to them.
