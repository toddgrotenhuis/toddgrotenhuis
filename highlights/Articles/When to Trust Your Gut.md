## Highlights
- Often, your gut is just plain wrong—because it’s subject to biases.
- Place yourself in unfamiliar situations. You’ll begin seeing new connections.
- Acquire a diverse background. Our instincts often kick in when we draw on patterns we’ve seen but can’t quite articulate. The more varied your experiences, the more extensive your “encyclopedia” of patterns. You’ll begin seeing similar patterns across disparate fields—patterns others may overlook. This “cross-indexing” elevates your intuitive skills from good to sublime.
  
- Know—and check—yourself. Watch for tendencies that cloud your decision making: taking unnecessary risks to cover a loss, “overfitting data” (seeing patterns where none exist), practicing revisionism (failing to remember times when you were right not to trust your gut), and being too confident to get feedback on your mistakes (hence failing to learn from them).
