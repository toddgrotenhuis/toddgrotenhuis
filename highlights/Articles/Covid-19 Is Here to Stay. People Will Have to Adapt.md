## Highlights
- Epidemiologists understand how to stop covid-19. You catch it indoors, in crowds, when people raise their voices. The poor are vulnerable, as are the elderly and those with other conditions. You can contain the virus with three tactics: changes in behaviour; testing, tracing and isolation; and, if they fail, lockdowns.
- Masks help stop the disease, but in Europe and America some refuse to wear one because they see them as emasculating or, worse, Democratic.
- You may have lost interest in the pandemic. It has not lost interest in you.
