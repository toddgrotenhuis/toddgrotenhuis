## Highlights
- It’s not about queerness at all. It’s actually about the disaster of heterosexuality—and what, if anything, can be salvaged from its ruins.
- In each new installment of the reboot, queerness is gently suggested as an antidote to the hot mess of toxic masculinity under late-stage capitalism.
- The gimmick is that heterosexuality is a disaster, toxic masculinity is killing the world, and there are ways out of it aside from fascism or festering away in a lonely bedroom until you are eaten by your starving pitbull or your own insecurities.
- The only reason it looks like some street punks broke into an abandoned Claire’s is that queer millennials are poor. We are just as likely to be directionless, in debt and frustrated by life as your average cis straight millennial, but less likely to place the blame where it doesn’t belong.
- Straight guys in the global north are not the people objectively suffering most under late capitalism’s slow collapse into chaotic neo-nationalism. They are just the people whose problems have historically been treated as more important.
- The problems these men have are largely ones that actually can be solved by a basic attitude and wardrobe upgrade, and that’s the irony here. Women, queer people, and people of color are the people who are usually told that the problem isn’t the world, it’s us. We are told that we are to blame not only for the wreck of our own lives but also for everyone else’s as well, because we selfishly refused to flatten ourselves for the comfort of others. Men, by contrast, are perennially assured that the world is theirs, to be made over in their image. Or they were, until recently.
- Gloria Steinem has often reminded the world that women’s liberation involves liberated women “becoming the men we wanted to marry.”
- The work that the Fab Five are doing for the luckless, loveless men of Georgia is girlfriend work. It is emotional labor, domestic labor, the work that anyone who has ever dated a straight man will recognize.
- The reason you could get any five women off the street to do this job is not because women are born magically knowing how to dry your tears and clean your bathroom, but because female socialization is a long apprenticeship devoted to developing these skills for yourself and others. The idea that it is natural for any female person to just be good at all this stuff obscures a hell of a lot of work.
- I would imagine that Bobby at least has an interior design qualification, that someone actually taught Jonathan how to cut hair, that Karamo is some flavor of professional life coach or counselor when he’s not being coerced into cuddling racist cops on television.
- Money is the silent sixth member of the rescue squad. The services that the Fab Five are offering are worth more than most of these men could possibly afford—there are thousands of dollars of new clothes and furniture on offer here, and frankly, that’s no shabby way to advertise tolerance.
- That’s how you get Karamo in a car trying to pretend that his misgivings about spending time with a white police officer who owns a MAGA hat are a prejudice exactly as irrational and immoral as the cop’s feelings about gay black men, telling us that everyone can learn something valuable from each other if we all just sit down and chat.
- Many political roadblocks would be more navigable if the general public did not so often mistake their comfort zone for the moral high ground.
- The truth is that it’s frightening outside the comfort zone of most straight, cis, able-bodied men who were told they deserved the world.
- if you frame “acceptance” as the major challenge facing the twenty-first century gay communities, there’s not a lot of airtime left for other problems that they’re actually facing.
- we’ve had quite enough of gay men and women having to court jester the whole damn world just to be allowed to exist on something like their own terms.
- It is not queer people’s job to save straight people from the sinking ocean liner of heterosexuality any more than it is the job of women to save men from lifetimes of loneliness and rumpled jean shorts. All of us have enough to do manning the life rafts for ourselves and for each other.
- Give a man a makeover and you fix him for a day; teach a man that masculinity under late capitalism is a toxic pyramid scheme that is slowly killing him just like it’s killing the world, and you might just fix a sucking hole in the future.
