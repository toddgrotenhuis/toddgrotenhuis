## Highlights
- No, far from counter-attacking capitalism in defense of “communism,” I acknowledge that Marxism-Leninism has been an authoritarian, extractive system of class power. I attack capitalism in addition to Marxism-Leninism, as another authoritarian, extractive system of class power, equally tied up with the state and with a death toll comparable to that of “communism.”
- Therefore apologists for capitalism own the long, bloody history of death recorded in the pages of its Black Book, every bit as much as any Marxist-Leninist owns the death toll of the Ukraine famine, the Stalinist purges, the starvation during the Great Leap Forward, or the killing fields of Cambodia. These deaths, commemorated on Victims of Capitalism Day, are yours. This Black Book is yours. They are the legacy of the capitalist system you’ve sold your souls to defend. Embrace them as your own, or shut the fuck up about “communism.”
