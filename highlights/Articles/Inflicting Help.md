## Highlights
- The Right Help at the Wrong Time
  For help to truly be helpful, the recipients must be ready for it, and as would-be helpers we need to assess their readiness accurately. It's easy to misread potential openness for an actual invitation, so it's essential to bear in mind that help is helpful when it's asked for.
- The Right Help, But Too Much Of It
  Alternatively, we can offer help and have it received with gratitude, but we may not know when to stop. The desire to help takes over, and we pass the point of diminishing returns and keep on going. As helpers we need to be keenly attuned to recipients' ability to make effective use of our help and to stop helping when it's no longer helpful.
- The Wrong Help
  Someone wants our help, and we’re able to offer it at the right time, but as the situation evolves it becomes clear that what we’re offering isn’t actually what’s needed. As helpers we may think we know what’s needed, but even--and perhaps especially--when we’re viewed as experts we need to access our ignorance and be open to the possibility that we may be wrong.
