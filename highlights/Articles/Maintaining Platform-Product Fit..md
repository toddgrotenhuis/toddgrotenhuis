## Highlights
- Early systems are not perfect but they are perfectly appropriate to the exact needs and constraints of the business
- Mature products emphasize stability, security, predictable feature development, and establishing efficient economies of scale. Early products require rapid iteration, broad exploration, user validation, and interpret most other aspects of platform quality as friction.
- This transition from single product into product portfolios is a common juncture for internal platform groups to become misaligned with their users, as they struggle to navigate tradeoffs in an abruptly expanded possibility space.
- This can lead to a dismal loop, where the expansion of product lines implicitly increase the demands on infrastructure teams, followed by product teams surface their frustrations in reduced platform support to leadership, who respond by reducing funding to platform teams due to retrograde impact. This cycle culminates in undersized platform teams and the emergence of homegrown pseudo-platform teams within each product team, deprieving the company of the opportunity to use technology as a leverage point. Without platform leverage, internal work downshifts the fundamental unit of progress from working software to working hours.
- When good intentions are insufficient, deliberate discussion is the next step. Any attempt to address an imbalance in platform-product-fit should start from three truths:
  there is always be more demand for platform work than supply,
  platform and product teams that compete head-to-head for headcount reach ineffective equilibriums,
  company scale culminates in diffuse platform-product requirements.
- An investment thesis articulates the extent to which you'll support which product requirements over time. For example, you might specify 50% focus on the company's core mature business, 30% on new product development, and 20% on underlying platform quality. The thesis also articulates how you'll staff these efforts.
  For staffing, a surprisingly effective format is the simplest: identify a ratio between folks working on internal platforms and the size of teams they support, and maintain that ratio.
