Justice & Fairness: Something is "bad" if it is unfair or unequal. Ingroup Loyalty: Standing with your group (e.g., family, tribe, nation) is "good" betrayal and disloyalty are "bad." Respect for Authority: Respecting and submitting to tradition and authority figures is "good." Sanctity & Purity: Respecting sacred spaces, times, objects, traditions, rituals, and institutions is "good."
