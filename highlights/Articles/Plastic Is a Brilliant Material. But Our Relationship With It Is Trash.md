## Highlights
- What this production costs us in terms of energy and CO2 emissions is hard to estimate. Because of the diversity of types of plastic, it’s hard to find reliable, comprehensive data for the plastic industry. That it’s bad for the environment is beyond dispute. Plastic is one of the cornerstones of the fossil industry. Not so much because of the amount of fossil fuels used – that’s actually not so high – but because of how indispensable plastic is in our society. 
- At least 14% of oil and natural gas production goes towards petrochemistry, but this also includes ammonia production – the primary ingredient of An estimated 4-5% of all fossil raw materials are used for the production of all sorts of plastic
- In terms of CO2 emissions, only the production of cement and iron and steel create more pollution than petrochemistry
- the petrochemical industry is the biggest energy consumer
- Where nearly all companies do their best to make their products valuable, the plastic industry has taken the opposite approach. Plastic is nothing. It needs to be invisible, often literally, even. It was consciously designed so that it is virtually impossible to use it for anything else, making you want to throw it away as quickly as possible.
- This is the problem of the plastic bag: as consumers we have been taught to see what is essentially a valuable, reusable and useful product as a worthless, easily replaceable product.
