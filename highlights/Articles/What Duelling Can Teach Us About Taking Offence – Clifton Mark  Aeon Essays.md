## Highlights
- When people take offence, they are trying to silence those who offend them. Call this concept of offence offence-as-hurt.
- The main theoretical counter to this view is to argue that offence is not about ‘hurt feelings’, but about real harm.
- Words wound, and the wounds are no less real for not being physical. This view has frequently been used to argue for legal prohibitions on hate speech. Call this view offence-as-harm.

- In 18th-century France, ‘to take offence’ had a very specific meaning: to challenge another man to a duel.
- To offend meant to insult or to disrespect, not to hurt one’s feelings. And to take offence was to reply to an insult by demanding a show of respect. I call this third alternative offence-as-insult.
- The second will show how the same basic concept of offence-as-insult that underlies duelling can make more sense of today’s controversies over offensive speech than either offence-as-hurt or offence-as-harm.
