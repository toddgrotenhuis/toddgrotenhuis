## Highlights
- And since so many digital revenue models are built around engagement, the lower the barriers, the better. Friction gets in the way of profits.
- Speed bumps that slow users down in how they write and share online are probably necessary to move us from reactive to reflective.
- Bad actors require users (and occasionally bots) to spread their content by mindlessly sharing and commenting on it. Small roadblocks that slow users down could lessen all the mindless consumption and communication. By increasing the time from head-to-said and from seen-to-share, we can likely decrease hate speech and misinformation online.
- How we act is often related to the amount of time we have to consider our action. Human behavior is not fixed. This is the very idea behind a cooling-off period, which allows for a greater level of consideration before a final action.
- the public is trying to shame platforms into altering their behavior—basically asking companies with shareholders to make less money. That hasn’t worked, because what we are asking of the tech companies is in conflict with their duty to maximize profits. A company that wants to do the right thing would be at a competitive disadvantage.
