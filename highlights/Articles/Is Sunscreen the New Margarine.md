## Highlights
- People with low levels of vitamin D in their blood have significantly higher rates of virtually every disease and disorder you can think of: cancer, diabetes, obesity, osteoporosis, heart attack, stroke, depression, cognitive impairment, autoimmune conditions, and more.

- Yet vitamin D supplementation has failed spectacularly in clinical trials. Five years ago, researchers were already warning that [it showed zero benefit,](https://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/12/11/limits-of-vitamin-d-supplements/?action=click&module=RelatedCoverage&pgtype=Article&region=Footer) and the evidence has only grown stronger. In November, [one of the largest and most rigorous trials](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1809944) of the vitamin ever conducted—in which 25,871 participants received high doses for five years—found no impact on cancer, heart disease, or stroke.

- rates of high blood pressure, heart disease, stroke, and overall mortality all rise the farther you get from the sunny equator, and they all rise in the darker months ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01g4hqqnvhafjjd577p0zq1szy))
- Wouldn’t all those rays also raise rates of skin cancer? Yes, but skin cancer kills surprisingly few people: less than 3 per 100,000 in the U.S. each year. For every person who dies of skin cancer, more than 100 die from cardiovascular diseases. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01g4hqs37t6resfr9kawvrefkz))
- People don’t realize this because several different diseases are lumped together under the term “skin cancer.” The most common by far are basal-cell carcinomas and squamous-cell carcinomas, which are almost never fatal ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01g4hqv5nbkf7gxe7ne6wdjdxg))
- Melanoma, the deadly type of skin cancer, is much rarer, accounting for only 1 to 3 percent of new skin cancers. And perplexingly, outdoor workers have half the melanoma rate of indoor workers. Tanned people have lower rates in general. “The risk factor for melanoma appears to be intermittent sunshine and sunburn, especially when you’re young,” says Weller. “But there’s evidence that long-term sun exposure associates with less melanoma.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01g4hqtrzvaxk0bxew53k9g98f))
- Over the 20 years of the study, sun avoiders were twice as likely to die as sun worshippers. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01g4hqyv1wz80km4hhznhhctx8))
- Vitamin D now looks like the tip of the solar iceberg. Sunlight triggers the release of a number of other important compounds in the body, not only nitric oxide but also serotonin and endorphins. It reduces the risk of prostate, breast, colorectal, and pancreatic cancers. It improves circadian rhythms. It reduces inflammation and dampens autoimmune responses. It improves virtually every mental condition you can think of. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01g4hr1qs050e6ezd2jdvyasrg))
- These seem like benefits everyone should be able to take advantage of. But not all people process sunlight the same way. And the current U.S. sun-exposure guidelines were written for the whitest people on earth. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01g4hr2484mg1t14jg9zv0bks9))
- Even today, SPF ratings refer only to UVB rays, so many users may be absorbing far more UVA radiation than they realize. Meanwhile, many common sunscreen ingredients have been found to be hormone disruptors that can be detected in users’ blood and breast milk. The worst offender, oxybenzone, also mutates the DNA of corals and is believed to be killing coral reefs. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01g4hrbk2tzavpr843d463357e))
- All the experts agree that sunburns—especially those suffered during childhood and adolescence—are particularly bad. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01g4hrf78svvkcy8b265c33qkq))
