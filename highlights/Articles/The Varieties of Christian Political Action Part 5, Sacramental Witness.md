## Highlights
- churches do sacramentally display an alternative politics in the midst of the world. This sacramental display and embodiment of the kingdom of God in midst the world is what I'm calling sacramental witness. As a sacramental witness the church makes the politics of the kingdom of God visible within, to and for the world.
- The sacramental witness of the church is like a flash mob. The faithful gather to make the politics of the kingdom visible, and then they disperse. This sacramental witness sustains hope, provides encouragement, recalibrates the heart, galvanizes action, narrates a story, sets a moral direction, leavens the imagination, and makes visible a prophetic contrast to the political status quo.
- even non-religious protests and movements can engage in sacramental witnessing, making something heretofore invisible (or hard to visualize) visible in our midst. For example, I'd would argue that the Occupy Wall Street movement is best described as a sacramental witness
- Occupy was, therefore, more about imagination than power. And this, I would argue, is similar to the sacramental witness of the church.
