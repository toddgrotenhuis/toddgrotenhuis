## Highlights
- We also tested the filtration of surgical masks that had been worn, crumpled up in pockets and purses, and washed with soap and water up to 10 times. These masks still prevented more virus particles from passing through than typical cloth masks. Masks with even better filtration or fit than surgical masks, such as KF94 or KN95 masks, may provide even stronger protection than surgical masks if worn properly.
