## Highlights
- A tech movement spurred by visions of libertarian empowerment and progressive uplift has instead fanned a global resurgence of populism and authoritarianism
- predicting what is useful, however value-neutral this may sound, can shade into deciding what is useful
- Google hoped to provide users with more “useful” information, but if you already know what you want to believe, Google exaggerates confirmation bias by feeding you more of what you want to hear.
- By pulling so much of social life into cyberspace, the information revolution has made dissent more visible, manageable, and manipulable than ever before.
