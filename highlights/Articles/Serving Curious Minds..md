## Highlights
- Make personal accountability a habit. The four steps, or seeing the problem, owning the problem, solving the problem and doing what is needed to change it, should be how you live your life, not simply a one-time lucky moment.
- Remember that each failure is a learning experience, in which you figure out what doesn’t work, to come closer to solutions that will.
- Let your frustrations out; then get to work!
