## Highlights
- As I wrote last December, a more transmissible variant is terribly worrisome—more so than one that was lethal at a similar percentage, because lethality is a linear measure, while transmissibility is an exponential threat. One of my favorite quotes from this year is from Dylan H. Morris: “You cannot finesse the steep part of the exponential.” Exponential dynamics are huge threats (or, if you are trying to grow a social network online, a huge opportunity) and cause for massive concern. 
- Using non-pharmaceutical interventions as best we can to drive down transmission is also crucial. However, at this point, the messaging can’t just be telling people to “mask up” or “stay home.” Those who are wearing masks are doing so already—they need better, certified masks. And for most of the victims of this pandemic, “stay home” is a function of privilege. In most countries where we have research, we find that the younger victims are those we call “essential” frontline workers: the people who cannot work from home but who make our society run. They cannot just stay home, because we all depend on them to keep our society functioning. And besides, they cannot afford to stay home.
