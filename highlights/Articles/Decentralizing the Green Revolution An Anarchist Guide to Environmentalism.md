## Highlights
- Now to be fair, as long as the state exists, it is much better for them to be focused on environmental protection and social welfare than warfare and policing.
- government recycling programs were actually a scheme concocted by big corporations to pass the blame off from them to the individual. Instead of placing the responsibility for waste and environmental degradation at the feet of the corporations who use unsustainable packaging for their products, we blame the consumer for littering or not recycling.
- The best approach is to reduce the amount of waste you produce in the first place.
- The green anarchist movement has a rich history with organizations spanning from Earth First! to Food Not Lawns to the Earth Liberation Front to Murray Bookchin’s Institute for Social Ecology.
- instead of fighting for state subsidies for renewable energy or taxes on carbon emissions, let’s get to the root of the problem which includes corporate subsidies themselves.
- We need to demand an end to corporate subsidies for the oil, gas, factory farming, and agricultural industries first and foremost
- Subsidies of any kind offset the true costs of doing business, including the environmental costs, allowing corporations to survive despite unstable practices.
- We also need to break up the state-enforced public utilities monopolies which stifle competition and punish people for going off-grid.
- We must also block their projects. Banning fracking and stripmining practices, abolishing eminent domain laws, invoking personal property rights claims, especially indigenous property rights, against corporations, and utilizing environmental lawyers such as Water Protector Legal Collective and Earthjustice to challenge corporate and state actors are some ways to achieve these goals.
- We also need to stop factory farming practices and harmful agricultural practices.
- But winning any of these struggles in the long run won’t be possible if we don’t have alternatives already in place to replace the current systems.
- That means that we also need to be spreading the use of appropriate technologies such as solar, hydro, wind power, biofuels, and biomass.
- Providing alternatives to our current mainstream food sources is essential. In the face of industrial and factory farming we must turn to solutions such as permaculture, vertical farming, organic farming, small-scale livestock farming, hunting, and buying from local farms, farmers markets, and sustainable sources
- Reforestation, trash cleanups, water filtration technology, air filtration technology, trash eating robots, Precious Plastic, composting, etc. all provide ways to deal with the damage we have caused as a species.
