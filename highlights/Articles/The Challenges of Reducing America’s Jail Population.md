## Highlights
- Bail-reform advocates say that keeping unconvicted people detained before trial violates the presumption of innocence. The money-bail system, in which defendants pay cash as a guarantee that they will show up in court, means that only those with spare dollars can wait for their trial at home. The poor must either turn to the $2.3bn commercial-bondsmen industry—companies, found only in America or the Philippines, which bail out defendants for a fee—or wait in pretrial detention.
- The Bronx Freedom Fund is one of several charities that bail out poor defendants. Between 2013 and 2014 98% of the organisation’s clients showed up for their court dates, despite the lack of a personal financial incentive. Such data have pushed the case for abolishing cash bail, says David Feige, the Fund’s chairman.
- the algorithms used to determine who gets bailed and who does not are said to entrench the kind of racial discrimination that getting rid of cash bail was supposed to solve.
