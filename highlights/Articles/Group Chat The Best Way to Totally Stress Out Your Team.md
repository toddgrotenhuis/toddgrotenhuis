## Highlights
- What began as a novel way to quickly communicate company-wide has become a heavy-handed interruption factory with serious consequences.
- Group chat used sparingly in a few very specific situations makes sense. What makes a lot less sense is chat as the primary, default method of communication inside an organization.
- Software developers are prone to saying “well, then you’re using it wrong.” Or “it’s not the tool’s fault, it’s how you use it.” That’s a cop out. Tools encourage default behaviors, they dictate patterns and golden paths. These represent the tool makers’ ideal user experiences. If following along breaks your back, then it’s not because you tried to lift too much, it’s because the tool applied pressure in all the wrong places. The wrong defaults can damage morale and defeat organizations.
- Following group chat all day feels like being in an all-day meeting with random participants and no agenda.
- chat conditions us to believe everything’s worth discussing quickly right now, except that hardly anything is.
- Thinking a line at a time rather than a thought at a time.
- Decisions get made without people’s consent because they weren’t there at the very moment it was discussed.
- Be careful — it’s fun to hook things up and pipe stuff in, but what are the costs to people’s attention? Is it worth potentially pulling them away from their work a dozen times a day (you know how people love checking unreads) just to tell them something that could have waited until later?
- Further, like your muscles remember repetitive tasks (muscle memory), your mind does too — and jumping around rapidly between conversations all day creates “attention residue” that makes it hard to clear your mind of the previous conversation before starting the next conversation. This makes it difficult to fully consider the conversation you’re about to enter.
- Asynchronous communication is far better when working with teams spread across the world or even just a few time zones apart.
- If something else controls your attention, that something else controls what you’re capable of.
- Basically, right now should be the exception, not the rule. That creates space and attention for the things that really do have to be discussed right now, and allows everything else to be thoroughly discussed asynchronously and thoughtfully over time.

- If it’s an important conversation, it shouldn’t happen in the chat room. Chat should be about quick, ephemeral things.
- Thoughtful feedback isn’t just an answer, it’s time + an answer.
- There are lots of managers out there who love group chat because they can pop-in-and-out quickly and speak to many people at once, but there are a lot of employees out there sweating all day long trying to keep up appearances of being involved but knowing they have actual work to do.
- If the design leads to stress, it’s a bad design.
