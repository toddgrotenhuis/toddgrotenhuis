## Highlights
- Insulin as a very anabolic (building/growing) hormone, and does the following:
  Drives glucose into muscles where it can be turned into glycogen
  Plays a role in glycogen synthesis in the liver
  Increases fatty acid uptake into fat cells
  In short: Insulin makes fat cells more fat, it makes muscle cells more glycogen rich, and it makes the liver more glycogen rich. 
- The typical progression from normal to severely insulin resistant:
  >Glucose stays relatively low after the ingestion and so does insulin (normal) 
  >> insulin goes up while glucose stays down (first thing that usually goes wrong)
  >>>Glucose goes up while insulin stays up
  >>>>Fasting glucose going up and then fasting insulin going up (once fasting glucose gets high enough you’re very close to diabetes)
- In a healthy individual, 80-90% of consumed glucose is stored as glycogen (in muscle and liver)
  The muscle is the predominant place where we dispose of glucose
- Gerald’s work established where the macro defect was — It’s that an insulin resistant person can’t make glycogen effectively, so something is blocking that process
- The insulin sensitive person 
  They can take a lot of fat and run it through their mitochondria
  They have high fat oxidation in their mitochondria (and when necessary they can oxidize glucose in their mitochondria)
  They can also store glucose as glycogen in the muscle
  Contrast that with the person with type 2 diabetes
  They now have double defect—
  They can’t store glucose in the form of glycogen 
  And their fat oxidation is dramatically reduced
  So they are now relying solely on glucose for oxidation
  They have less fat oxidation, it’s probably driving up their DAGs, which is further exacerbating their glucose transport problem
- Can carbohydrates be turned into fat, and if so, how much of a contribution is that to our overall fatness? 
  And the answer is that it really depends on the context and the metabolic condition of the individual
  In an insulin-sensitive individual, it turns out that the creation of liver fat is really not that much (especially when you’re eating more glucose than fructose)
  The more insulin resistant you are, and the more fructose you’re eating, the more de novo lipogenesis can become a huge part of the problem
- Fuel partitioning is basically asking, Where can you put this fuel? 
  If you have a lot of muscle, you’ve got a reservoir where you can put that glucose in a healthy person
  The glucose goes into the muscle more readily, and it can be reconstituted into glycogen more readily
  In the type 2 diabetics, that process happens to a much lower extent—it is not shut off completely, but their muscle sensitivity is lower

- An illuminating study was published in 1996 in the NEJM: Increased Glucose Transport–Phosphorylation and Muscle Glycogen Synthesis after Exercise Training in Insulin-Resistant Subjects
  They looked at the impact of a single bout of exercise on insulin stimulated muscle glycogen synthesis
  They found that just one 45-minute bout of aerobic exercise—three 15-minute sets at ~65% of your maximal aerobic capacity—restored the concentration of glucose-6-phosphate and the rate of glycogen synthesis in the muscle of insulin resistant participants to that of the baseline or pre-exercise level of the insulin sensitive participants
  In other words, exercise is boosting insulin sensitivity and glucose disposal
  This is crucial because a big issue with insulin resistant/diabetic people is that it seems like they can’t put the glucose into the muscle and synthesize it into glycogen
  But this study showed that one bout of exercise made that possible
- the key takeaway is that you have an insulin resistant person exercise and make their muscles look like an insulin sensitive person at rest
- In summary:
  The importance of exercise in this situation cannot be overstated
  Combine exercise with regulating carbohydrate level to your tolerance, reducing fructose intake, etc. for even better results
  This is great news because we now know metabolic syndrome, NAFLD, NASH, don’t need drugs to cure them

- First, you want to know that you’re insulin resistant long before it shows up in a traditional way
  You don’t want to wait until your hemoglobin A1C is 6.5 and you’re being diagnosed with T2D
  This means you need to be getting an oral glucose tolerance test
  Second big takeaway, exercise really matters a lot
  45 minutes of submaximal/zone 2 exercise
  Zone 2 means roughly 65% of VO2 max, and about at the limit of where you can still carry on a conversation
  This exercise had an immediate and direct effect on glucose disposal
  Over time, so chronically, that’s going to have an even greater effect
- Thirdly, there is an enormous role for dietary intervention
  Specifically, fructose reduction and glucose reduction until a homeostasis is achieved
- In summary: Exercise and nutrition are a first line of defense against metabolic syndrome
- If you have an interest in being healthy you can’t be insulin resistant. If you are insulin resistant, you’re not going to be healthy. . .But if you’re in the business of wanting to live the healthiest life you can live, which means longer and better, you’ve got to be insulin sensitive, full stop.
