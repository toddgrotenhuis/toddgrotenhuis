## Highlights
- Only a robust notion of human sanctity, or the inviolable dignity of persons, is capable of explaining our moral repugnance toward violence and killing.
- Is not the duty to love oneself based on one’s inviolable dignity (not the other way around)?
- What we feel about ourselves or about others may be relevant in terms of virtue, but intentionality alone doth not make an act moral or immoral.
- God’s love is upside-down from our laws of calculation, as it extends especially to those who least deserve it.
- If, then, we believe in the sanctity of human life, we must also believe that killing is wrong – always. Peter Singer recognized this; John Paul II and C.S. Lewis (and many others) try, while affirming human sanctity, to evade the point by justifying some kinds of killing. Their attempt is understandable from a pragmatic point of view, but it’s not logically defensible without abandoning or cheapening the very human sanctity they claim is absolute.
