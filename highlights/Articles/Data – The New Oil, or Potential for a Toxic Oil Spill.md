## Highlights
- The harms from breaches are stochastic (i.e., randomly determined), not deterministic.
- Inevitably, we will see the framework for breach remedies transformed to look more like the remedies for other probabilistic harms, such as environmental harms.
- Maybe you could still justify all that risk if the profits from all that data were commensurate with it. But as researchers keep discovering, the benefits from data are wildly oversold – the efficacy of ad targeting based on users’ behavior is almost identical targeting based on the content of the pages where the ads appear, which requires no user data.
- Data minimization isn’t just good practice; it’s good business. Collect as little data as you can, and keep it as briefly as you can.
