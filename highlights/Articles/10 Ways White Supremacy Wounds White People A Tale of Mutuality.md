## Highlights
- the cost of white privilege and white supremacy for white people is nothing short of trading in humanity for the illusion of comfort.
- Naming the ways in which white supremacy wounds white people is a way to move past the “helping” or “service” model to become “co-conspirators” and “comrades” in the movement for racial justice.
  
- Instructing white people to dissociate from our bodies and revere 'thinking' over feeling, intimacy, or paying attention to the information/wisdom our bodies give to us.
- Forcing people of European descent to erase our culture in order to conform to whiteness and white, dominant culture.
  
- Living on this land with no connection or understanding of the land we are on 
- Ingraining in white people the values of dominance, greed, and simplistic notions of “winners” and “losers,” and rewarding those who display those qualities with ever increasing access to wealth and power and admiring them for their dominance.
- Fostering a sense that people of color are always interested in vengeance for the harms white people have perpetrated, creating a sublimated, constant anxiety about one's status and an inability to envision a world based on equity and human connection.
- Instilling in white people a scarcity mentality, making such things as neoliberal capitalism, mass incarceration, xenophobia, continued fossil fuel extraction, and the never-ending “War on Terror” appear defensible and even necessary.
