## Highlights
- Summarizing, the intellectual response to evil are all those abstract theological debates about why God permits evil to exist. 
  The moral response to evil is how we should refuse to be reconciled to evil and should struggle against it in the world. 
  Finally, the pastoral response to evil is how we come alongside those who are suffering or who are victims of evil.
