## Highlights
- To recap, the first fork in the road regarding a taxonomy of Christian political action concerns Christian responsibility for history. For Christians answering "yes" to that question in Part 2 we described the political action available to them, Christian realism versus a revolutionary politics. Now we turn to forms of political action that do not assume responsibility for history.
- let me describe today the first sort of political action, among three I'll discuss, that doesn't involve itself in wielding the power of the state. I'm calling this type of political action "leavening presence," borrowing some from James Davison Hunter's notion of "faithful presence" in his book To Change the World.   By leavening presence think of the stories of Joseph and Daniel as they serve in Egypt and Babylon.
- The Jews in Babylon had no political power, and they were not tasked with righting the wrongs of the nation state. They were not asked to take responsibility for Babylonian history. They were, however, asked to participate in seeking the welfare of the city. Seeking that welfare, outside of state politics, is what I'm calling "leavening presence," actions that bring peace and wholeness to our communities. The Jewish people were to be a leavening presence in Babylon.
- Phrased differently, they humanized dehumanizing structures.
- Leavening presence, then, can be expressed by individuals and groups. For example, in your workplace, like Daniel in Babylon, you can live within that system as a leaving presence, bringing kindness and wisdom to an organization that lacks those virtues. In addition to our individual presences in the organizations we inhabit, leavening presence also names how local churches care for their communities in numerous ways, providing food, clothing, shelter, and financial help to their neighbors. None of this political action attempts to wield the power of the nation state.
- In short, leavening presence is Christian political action that seeks to rehumanize a dehumanized world outside of the structures of the nation state. As individuals we serve where we find ourselves as people of virtue, inserting grace and peace to the limits of our power within a given institution or workplace. As churches or participants in organizations of care we provide material support and aid for our neighbors. We function, to use Jesus's phrase, as salt and light. We live as leaven in the world.
