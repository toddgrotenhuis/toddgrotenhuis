## Highlights
- ResearchGate, a site that has engaged in mass copyright infringement in order to make research accessible. 
- SciHub is a completely illegal but extremely convenient means of obtaining academic research for free
- Often, because journal publishers tightly control access to their copyrighted work in order to charge those exorbitant fees for PDFs, the versions of articles that you can get for free are drafts that have not yet gone through peer review, and have thus been subjected to less scrutiny. 
- The amount of time wasted in figuring out how to obtain a piece of research material is a massive cost on top of the actual pricing.
- copyright law is an unbelievably intensive restriction on freedom of speech, sharply delineating the boundaries of what information can and cannot be shared with other people.
- dead people cannot be incentivized to be creative, thus at least everything ever created by a person who is now dead should be made freely available to all.

- As Adam Habib, Vice-Chancellor for research at the University of Johannesburg explains, academic publishing is a “completely feudal system”:
  “The costs of the research production are borne by the universities, and as a result, by public monies, in most cases. Then, private companies publish the research, and charge the universities and public institutions for the very research outputs that they paid for. This is effectively the subsidy of the private sector by public money.
- We can’t afford to keep our reach to those who like us so much that they are willing to pay money to listen, because then the free bullshit wins.
