## Highlights
- Like most of her compatriots, Taiwan’s president, Tsai Ing-wen, is proud of her country’s democracy and sympathetic to Hong Kong’s activists. The day before China imposed a ferocious security law on Hong Kong last month, her government amended its covid-related border closure to make it easier for people from Hong Kong to enter. The day after the law took effect, it opened an office in the city to help locals visit or emigrate to Taiwan.But Ms Tsai is indeed cautious: her government has not issued any sweeping offer of asylum. Instead, requests to resettle are considered case by case, and residency is often granted for mundane reasons, at least on paper. Mr Lam, for instance, is classified as an investor, since he set up a business in Taiwan.
- Even this muted assistance has provoked outrage from the Chinese Communist Party. It considers Taiwan to be part of its territory and has threatened to take control by force, if necessary. Chinese officials rail about a “conspiracy between Hong Kong independence activists and Taiwan independence activists”.
