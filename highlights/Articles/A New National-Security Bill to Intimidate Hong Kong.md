## Highlights
- It is not only the large numbers of young black-clad protesters at the forefront of the recent unrest who need worry. The law could be applied to a wide range of peaceful activity. For example, taking part in anything “unlawful” aimed at undermining China’s communist system could be considered subversive
- The bill implies that foreign firms in Hong Kong could be punished should they help a country apply sanctions against China.
