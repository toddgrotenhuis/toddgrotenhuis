## Highlights
- My aim is not to moralise, but rather to highlight the dangers of a political and economic system that profits from deceiving perhaps well-meaning self-proclaimed progressive folks into believing that a greener, more efficient capitalism is possible.
- Part of the conceit surrounding apolitical techno-focused environmentalism centres on the idea of dematerialising economic growth through more efficient lifestyles and technologies. These include using the latest labour-saving apps on your phone, purchasing energy-saving appliances, eating vegan or organic food, and constructing buildings with lower negative environmental impact.
  While these improvements in efficiency should indeed be applauded, they are not a solution to the major environmental problems we face today. This is because such "quick fixes" derive from the economic and political structures of capital expansion.
  Growth-based economies are at the heart of environmental disasters we face today; making our goods, economic activity or infrastructure "greener" and more efficient without a major overhaul of the global economic system is not a long-term solution.
  Improving efficiency would always involve maintaining and indeed expanding production to satisfy growing demand.
- Those who argue that growth can be accompanied by a dematerialising economic activity are convinced that these knowledge and creative classes of the service economy have somehow lower environmental impacts than those engaged in industrial agriculture or manufacturing (so-called "dirty" jobs). But is this information economy really any cleaner and greener?
  Not really. This is because the resources they need to operate fundamentally depend on manufacturing and intensive agriculture located increasingly further away from their sites of operation, and often carry with them significant environmental impacts and exploitative labour practices.
