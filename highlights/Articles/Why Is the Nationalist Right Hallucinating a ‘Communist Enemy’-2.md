## Highlights
- Why should anti-communism be so amenable to such racist, conspiracist, and apocalyptic thinking? Perhaps because it works in a similar way.
- Rather like a racial stereotype, “communism” figuratively represents systemic crises as something external, a demonic plot.
- Those labelled “communists” are thus blamed, not just for the reforms that they demand, but for the crises that call for reform.
- The hallucinatory world of anticommunism-without-communism is dangerous and violent. Its partisans believe they face an existential threat, which in principle licenses almost any level of violence
