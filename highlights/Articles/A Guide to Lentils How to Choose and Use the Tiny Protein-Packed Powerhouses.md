## Highlights
- Brown or green lentils. These are your standard grocery store variety. They skew on the larger side and can be firm or soft depending on how long you cook them and what you want to do with them. Since they can hold their shape more, these types of lentils work well as a swap for meat in taco fillings, sloppy Joes and more. They can stand in for French green or even black as needed. Cooking time: 30 to 40 minutes.
- Red, orange or yellow split lentils. You may also see some labeled as Egyptian or masoor dal. These break down very well and rather quickly, which is why they’re often used for Indian dal. Part of that, as Iyer explains, is because red lentils are in fact skinned and split brown lentils. Consider them for mashes, soups and stews. Madison recommends turning them into a puree, very easy to do with a food processor and still pretty easy even by hand with a mortar and pestle. Cooking time: 15 to 25 minutes or more, depending on how soft and disintegrated you want them.
- French green (du Puy) lentils. These small, blue-green-spotted lentils hold their shape when cooked but still maintain a creamy texture. Take advantage of their sturdiness in cold (even marinated) or warm salads. “They have a wonderful deep clean flavor, and they look marvelous on the plate,” says Deborah Madison in “The New Vegetarian Cooking for Everyone,” though she notes brown lentils can be subbed if necessary. You may also come across similar brown varieties from Italy (Castelluccio/Umbrian) and Spain (pardina). Cooking time: 25 to 30 minutes.
- Black beluga lentils. These maintain their shape and firm texture when cooked. Their resemblance to caviar — small, shiny and black — even prompted one brand to market them as “Beluga.” They’re great for salads or appetizers, such as on blini. Cooking time: 20 to 25 minutes.
- About 2 cups of dried lentils weigh 1 pound and will yield about 6 cups when cooked.
- “You needn’t be fearful about adding salt at the beginning of their short cook time,” Madison says. “In fact, this helps bring out their flavors.” You can infuse the lentils at the beginning with other flavors too, such as onions, spices and dried herbs (bay leaves in particular). Using broth instead of water is an option, as well.
- Consider lentils as a crunchy garnish. Cook them on the stove top, dry and then toss with oil and spices before transferring to the oven.
