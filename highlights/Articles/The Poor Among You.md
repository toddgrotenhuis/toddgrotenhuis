## Highlights
- As it turns out, “You will always have the poor among you” means exactly the opposite of how I heard it used over and over again during my decades in the cult of the white Jesus. It’s not an unfortunate inevitability to relieve the guilt of the privileged and powerful. It is a prophetic call to ensure that communities do not structure economic growth around the plundering of poor people.
- In the wilderness, God introduced Israel to Manna, a flaky food provision that was simple and sustainable. Manna was probably poo from aphids who defecate 130% of their body weight every hour. In desert contexts today, it is gathered up at the base of plants and baked into honey cakes. Apparently, God told the Israelites to eat shit. And it tasted great. Even more, the manna meal separated Israel from the mindset of the Egyptian colonial script. Manna connected Israel to the rhythms of Earth. It was about trusting and paying attention and receiving. It was about ensuring that everyone in the community had enough and that no one had too much. This was the opposite of excluding, exploiting and extracting so that a few had a fortune—while everyone else lived paycheck to paycheck.
- Jesus wasn’t dismissing his disciples’ meager attempts to eliminate poverty, but challenging them to live in close proximity to poor and marginalized people.
- Jesus wasn’t dissing the critical work required to get at the roots of poverty, but questioning the creative tricks utilized to flee from it. Our choice is simple: either live insulated from the poor or in solidarity with the poor. Where one lives determines what one learns. Jesus knew what the colonial script refuses to acknowledge—that the poor have plenty to teach us.
