## Highlights
- The successful people in your community or your industry (please substitute ‘happy’ for successful in that sentence) don’t act the way the influencers on Twitter, YouTube or Facebook do. That’s all invented, amplified stagecraft, it’s not the actual human condition.
- Make it almost impossible to get famous at the expense of civilization.
- Reward thoughtfulness and consistency and responsibility.
