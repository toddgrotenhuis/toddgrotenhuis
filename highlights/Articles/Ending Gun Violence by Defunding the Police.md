## Highlights
- Anarchists and many others in the radical left and libertarian movements are rightly skeptical of gun control due to the history of state power, including gun laws, being weaponized to directly target and oppress marginalized communities while simultaneously maintaining a state monopoly on violence. Despite the dangers of gun control, gun violence is still a very serious issue which we absolutely have to address in any productive way we can. Of course, most every proposal up until now has included gun control measures enforced by the police under threat of prison time or other retributive punishment. This is completely at odds with the current movements to defund and abolish the police and to end prison slavery and mass incarceration. Short of disarming police themselves, how can we address gun violence without empowering the police to further harass marginalized peoples and further contributing to mass incarceration? Well, I laid out many possibilities in my 6 part essay series [*Combating Hate*](https://c4ss.org/content/47489), and that’s a start, but we have to be able to do more in the here and now, right?
