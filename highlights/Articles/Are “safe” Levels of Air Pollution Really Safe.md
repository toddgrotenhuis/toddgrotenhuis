## Highlights
- Although dependent upon the PM2.5 levels, filter size, room size, and room ventilation, one may expect a typical portable HEPA filter to reduce PM2.5 by approximately 40%, according to a [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5052064/) that measured PM2.5 inside and outside of homes in Vancouver, Canada ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01g167gm8qjaphd56ytzvz3r3c))
- So when outdoor air quality is especially poor (typically regarded as ≥35µg/m3 for a 24-hour exposure, as was the case for many areas during the Western wildfires of 2021), an indoor treadmill session might be a safer option than a jog around the neighborhood. When we must be outdoors in polluted conditions, we can reduce our exposure by wearing a particulate respirator mask or by choosing times of day when air quality is at its best – typically in the [evenings](https://aaqr.org/articles/aaqr-19-07-oa-0362).

- the EPA is currently proposing to revise the annual standard to below the 12 µg/m3 limit based on scientific evidence gathered during their 2020 policy assessments ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01g16829k44ydwxv976wbs8hbs))
- the World Health Organization (WHO) has already lowered its own recommendations for safe PM2.5 limits from 10 µg/m3 in 2005 to 5 µg/m3 in its [2021 guidelines](https://www.who.int/news-room/feature-stories/detail/what-are-the-who-air-quality-guidelines).
