## Highlights
- We believe that effective behavior change stems from four factors: Closed-loop systems Body-awareness and interoception Accountability Personal control
- In a closed-loop system, it’s possible to directly attribute action with consequence. This is not to say that other behavioral mechanisms that give real-time feedback (like gamification, streaks, or community support) are not useful. Still, they are not closed-loop systems, as they don’t engender definite attribution.
- Fitness, sleep, heart rate, and activity data, on the other hand, is real-time and can have an immediate and measurable impact on how somebody responds to a choice. That helps us move towards a more intelligent technology that can determine the “weight” of the impact of various decisions (e.g., sleep, exercise, stress) on overall glycemic control.  This makes it a great candidate for a data stream we should consider adding soon.
- One of the reasons closed-loop systems are compelling in this context is because they improve interoception (also known as “somatic awareness”), which is a person’s sense of the internal state of their body at a moment in time.
- Having an awareness of signals originating within the body (i.e., a physical awareness of one’s heartbeat or respiratory patterns) is associated with better physical and mental health outcomes and increased motivation. Conditioning to improve interoception may be important in chronic pain, high blood pressure, gastrointestinal disorders, mood and anxiety disorders, addiction, and asthma.
