## Highlights
- The price for pursuing JavaScript for everything has been a monstrosity of modern complexity. Yes, it’s far more powerful than it ever was. But it’s also far more convoluted and time-consuming than is anywhere close to reasonable for the vast majority of web applications.
- But incidental complexity can absolutely break your back if you’re a small team where everyone has to do a lot. The tools and techniques forged in the belly of a huge company is often the exact opposite of what you need to make progress at your scale.
