## Highlights
- But there are two very different phenomena at play here, each of which subvert the flow of information in very distinct ways. Let’s call them *echo chambers* and *epistemic bubbles*. Both are social structures that systematically exclude sources of information. Both exaggerate their members’ confidence in their beliefs. But they work in entirely different ways, and they require very different modes of intervention. An epistemic bubble is when you don’t *hear* people from the other side. An echo chamber is what happens when you don’t *trust* people from the other side. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01fzjpb8q0mdsqksa0s0k5b805))

- Current usage has blurred this crucial distinction, so let me introduce a somewhat artificial taxonomy. An ‘epistemic bubble’ is *an informational network from which relevant voices have been excluded* *by omission*. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01fzjpcwwccz8ta48ztz65y92q))

- An ‘echo chamber’ is *a social structure from which other relevant voices have been actively discredited*. Where an epistemic bubble merely omits contrary views, an echo chamber brings its members to actively distrust outsiders. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01fzjpe8ymgde84sczhkzaw838))

- can pop an epistemic bubble simply by exposing its members to the information and arguments that they’ve missed. But echo chambers are a far more pernicious and robust phenomenon ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01g00x7bnxsfes76zz1rahpv10))
- Here’s a basic check: does a community’s belief system actively undermine the trustworthiness of any outsiders who don’t subscribe to its central dogmas? Then it’s probably an echo chamber. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01g03f1j93qkk337s88cx9tnfz))
- An echo chamber doesn’t destroy their members’ interest in the truth; it merely manipulates whom they trust and changes whom they accept as trustworthy sources and institutions. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01g03fa54ntp478a85djf37evs))
- Let’s call the modernised version of Descartes’s methodology the *social-epistemic reboot*. In order to undo the effects of an echo chamber, the member should temporarily suspend all her beliefs – in particular whom and what she trusts – and start over again from scratch. But when she starts from scratch, we won’t demand that she trust only what she’s absolutely certain of, nor will we demand that she go it alone. For the social reboot, she can proceed, after throwing everything away, in an utterly mundane way – trusting her senses, trusting others. But she must begin afresh *socially* – she must reconsider all possible sources of information with a presumptively equanimous eye. She must take the posture of a cognitive newborn, open and equally trusting to all outside sources. In a sense, she’s been here before. In the social reboot, we’re not asking people to change their basic methods for learning about the world. They are permitted to trust, and trust freely. But after the social reboot, that trust will not be narrowly confined and deeply conditioned by the particular people they happened to be raised by.
