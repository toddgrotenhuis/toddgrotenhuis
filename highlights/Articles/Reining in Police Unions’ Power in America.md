## Highlights
- Law enforcement is among the most heavily unionised sectors in America, and police unions occupy a unique position. They tend to be conservative, unlike much of the labour movement.
- Politically, police unions are shielded on both sides. The right dislikes confronting the police—in Wisconsin Scott Walker, a former Republican governor, specifically exempted police unions from a measure passed in 2011 that limited public unions’ collective bargaining rights—whereas the left is loth to take on unions.
- Union contracts for police forces in most of America’s 100 largest cities have provisions reducing police accountability.
