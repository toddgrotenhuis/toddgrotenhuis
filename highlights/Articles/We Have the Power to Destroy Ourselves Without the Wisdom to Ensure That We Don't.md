## Highlights
- The typical species lives about a million years. Our 200,000 years so far would put us about in our adolescence, just old enough to be getting ourselves in trouble, but not wise enough to have thought through how we should act.But a million years isn't an upper bound for how long we could live. The horseshoe crab, for example, has lived for 450 million years so far. The Earth should remain habitable for at least that long.
- Last century, humanity faced something like a 1% chance of ending its story in the nuclear age. This century, the risk is even higher. And I put it at about one in six, so a die roll or Russian roulette.
- We could think of all of these virtues and vices not just at an individual level, but at the level of humanity. I call these civilizational virtues and vices.
- We've had this exponential improvement in our power, but our wisdom has grown only falteringly, if at all. We have the power to destroy ourselves without the wisdom to ensure that we don't. That's why our situation is so unsustainable.
- losing everyone is so much worse than losing almost everyone because it's not just this destruction of our present, but the destruction of our future.
