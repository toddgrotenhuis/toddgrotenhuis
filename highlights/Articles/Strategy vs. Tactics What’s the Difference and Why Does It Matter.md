- being precise in your goal, to encompass the entirety of what you want to achieve, is necessary to articulate a good strategy.
- Plan: A consciously chosen series of actions to achieve a goal, made in advance.
- Ploy: A deliberate attempt to confuse, mislead or distract an opponent.
- Pattern: A consistent, repeated series of actions that achieve the desired result.
- Position: A considered relationship between an entity (organization, army, individual etc) and its context.
