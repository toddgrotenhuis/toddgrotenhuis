## Highlights
- the religion that animated their hateful cries, their violence against law enforcement, and their defacement of the heirlooms of our democracy, was the religion of white nationalism. They had far more in common with the crucifiers than the crucified. It was the godless religion of the terrorist.
- So, what are we to do? Well, it must start by remembering the plumb line against which we always measure our lives and the causes we support: the life of Jesus. And he is not an imaginary figure we get to transform into a cheerleader for whatever we want. His life and teaching is not ours to invent. Reread the gospels. Meditate upon the Sermon on the Mount. Absorb the very essence of Christ’s witness. It may not always provide specific guidance for every moment, but it will always orient us in the right direction.
  
- Truth is not something to be forced into the mold of existing beliefs, but rather the shape around which we form our beliefs. Which means we must not compromise with deceit for the sake of convenience. Lies are sins that beget sins; they are never tools God uses to move us to where we are meant to go. Those who practice deceit cannot be champions for the Kingdom, for there is no deceit in the presence of God.
- For the sign waved in the riot was right; Jesus does save. May he save us from ourselves and have mercy on us all.
