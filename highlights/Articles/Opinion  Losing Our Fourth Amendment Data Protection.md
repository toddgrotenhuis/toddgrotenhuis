## Highlights
- But it was also a stark reminder of how much our Fourth Amendment protections depend on what we — and, more important, what our judges — legitimately expect in terms of privacy.
- If our privacy extends only as far as we expect it to, then as soon as we begin expecting companies to collect lots of data about us, we stand to lose our Fourth Amendment protections for that data. The frequent data breaches we are exposed to and the continuous analysis of our information for the purpose of serving us ads may not just be changing our attitudes and ideas about privacy. They may actually be changing our legal rights, simply by rewiring our expectations of how much control we have over our personal data.
