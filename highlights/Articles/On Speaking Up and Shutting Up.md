## Highlights
- The impulse to stay quiet is rarely a purely personal phenomenon. While our individual psychology inevitably plays a role, there are almost always group dynamics that contribute to our inhibition. The human system we're operating within at that moment--the relationship, the event, the group, the culture--is unsettled by our voice in some way and is acting to protect itself by repressing us. This need not take the form of heavy-handed censorship or overt hostility--it's often expressed in warm and pleasant tones. But when the system realizes that our contribution could be embarrassing or threatening, particularly to someone in power, it reliably enacts a "defense routine," in management thinker Chris Argyris' phrase, to ward off the embarrassment or threat. [5] Thus the impulse to stay quiet--and the vital importance of resisting the system's repression by speaking up. [6] ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1408998785/16297514))
- The impulse to say one more thing is undeniably influenced by the surrounding human system as well, especially if it's one in which we've felt repressed in the past. But in this instance we've felt free to share our voice and have been participating actively. The person or people we're talking with have been listening, receptive, open to our influence--and yet somehow it's not enough for us. We want something more from them, and we want it now, and we feel a frantic sense of urgency to get those needs met. The interchange is winding down--it may have even ended--when we suddenly extend it at the last second, our words tumbling out in a rush. We feel triumphant!--and then it's obvious that we should have kept out mouths shut. Our final contribution was unnecessary and even counter-productive, and our urge to express it was nothing more than impatience and narcissism. Thus the impulse to say one more thing--and the vital importance of mindful self-restraint. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1408998785/16297520))
