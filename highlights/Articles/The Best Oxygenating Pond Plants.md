## Highlights
- Bog plants are, you guessed it, most well-suited to damp, bog-like conditions. Essentially, they do best along the edges of ponds where the soil is moist but there isn’t much standing water, as they are adapted to have only their roots submerged. This category includes some rhubarb species, as well as carnivorous plants like the [pitcher plant](https://pondinformer.com/trumpet-pitcher-sarracenia/).

- Marginal, or emergent, plants thrive in waters that are zero to six inches above their crown, otherwise known as the part of the plant that is not beneath the soil. Again, pond edges suit them best. Since part of the plant can exist within the water, they do provide some direct oxygenation. Common marginal plants are [cattails](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typha) (pictured), rushes, and beautiful lotuses. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01fxvhznnt3cngn7432ffw5y3p))

- Unsurprisingly, floating pond plants float atop the open water and do not require soil for their roots. They provide shade, habitat, and soak up excess nutrients (which in turn helps prevent [algae overgrowth](https://pondinformer.com/how-to-get-rid-of-algae-pond/)). Water hyacinth, water lettuce, and [duckweed](https://pondinformer.com/how-to-get-rid-of-duckweed-ponds/) are all members of the floating plant group.

- Out of all of the groups mentioned above, submersed pond plants are by far the best at providing oxygen and filtering your water to deter algae growth. Also known as [macrophytes](https://www.epa.gov/national-aquatic-resource-surveys/indicators-macrophytes), they thrive beneath the surface, providing valuable underwater habitat for fish. Some of them may have portions above the surface, such as leaves or flowers. As all or most of the plant is beneath the surface, oxygen is released directly into the water through photosynthesis during the day. [Hornwort](https://pondinformer.com/hornwort-ceratophyllum-demersum/), anacharis or elodea, and [eelgrass](https://pondinformer.com/vallisneria-americana/) are popular examples of submerged pond plants.

- Another benefit is that they help prevent [phytoplankton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phytoplankton) from becoming too abundant through providing shade and absorbing excess nutrients that algae thrive on. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01fxvj3dg39wcd029acetcsy55))
