## Highlights
- The Prince falls within a literary genre established during the Middle Ages, with precursors in ancient times, called “mirrors for princes”. These took the form of advice manuals for new rulers. The Prince followed this tradition in instructing political rulers how best to pursue security for the state and glory for themselves. However, it was innovative in three ways.
  First, Machiavelli aimed his book particularly at princes who obtain political power through usurpation or conquest, rather than at hereditary rulers who would, in his view, face fewer problems.
  Second, unlike his medieval and Renaissance predecessors, Machiavelli did not portray the state or its ruler as subject to religious oversight or moral restraints. He made no attempt to show what a pious and morally ideal prince would be like.
  Third, and most notoriously, The Prince shocked European society because of the methods that it recommended, including, where expedient, betrayals, purges, and assassinations.
