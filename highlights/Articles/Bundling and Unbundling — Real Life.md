## Highlights
- As Thompson argues, food delivery and the broader convenience industry serve as a support system for an overworked urban professional class, who are “too busy and depleted to cook.”

- In this sense, unbundling is a form of destruction — “creative destruction,” maybe, but destruction nonetheless. This perspective fails to properly value what doesn’t demonstrate an ability to support itself without any cross-subsidies, and implies that the less measurable benefits latent in ambiguity and adjacency shouldn’t be cultivated. But the texture of everyday life is mostly made up of such contiguity — the incidental context that surrounds specific goals and tasks in the form of human relationships and aesthetic pleasure.
- In such cases, a bundle becomes less a bargain than a form of coercion, locking users into arrangements that are harder to escape than what they replaced.
    - Note: Referring to an example where you're pulled into one platform/group for things, then get locked-in.
