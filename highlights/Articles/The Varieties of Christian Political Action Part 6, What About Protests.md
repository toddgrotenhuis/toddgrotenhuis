## Highlights
- Time to summarize! I've sketched out a taxonomy of Christian political action that includes the following:
  Christian Realism
  Christian Revolution
  Leavening Presence
  New World in the Shell of the Old
  Sacramental Witness
- Protests can show up in in three locations. Most protests, as I mentioned at one point in this series, are expressions of Christian realism. That is, most protests are attempts to sway democratic politics by expressing dissent and building a movement. The goal of the protest is political change. Next, some protests can also be revolutionary in nature, as a direct attempt to overthrow a political order. Lastly, some protests function as sacramental witness. Such protests often have an artistic, performative aspect
- As either a realistic or revolutionary political demand, "Defund the Police," for many voting citizens, black and white included, was and remains a non-starter. But we could also look at the request of "Defund the Police" as a sacramental witness, as a challenge to our collective imaginations. Could we create a world where we no longer required police? If so, what would it take to create that world? Personally, even if we don't think the request to be realistic, I think there's value in this sort of prompting and prodding, imagining a newer, more beautiful world.
- My point is simply that idealized political demands don't have to be realistic to be valuable. The Kingdom of God, as an eschatological imagination sacramentally expressed within history, is always going to appear utopian and impractical. But that is a judgment upon earth, not heaven.
