## Highlights
- If you want to improve real performance…
  There are two things you must do
  First remove the reasons people worry about perception. Remove the incentives, take away the carrot and the stick. People don’t need to be motivated to perform. They need the opportunity.
  Secondly improve the quality of your own perception. It is easy to pull the wool over the eyes of people who spend their lives looking at PowerPoint in board rooms. You can only accurately perceive performance by going and looking at it.
