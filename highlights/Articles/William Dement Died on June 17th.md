## Highlights
- The grounding of the Exxon Valdez, the near-meltdown at Three Mile Island, the loss of the space shuttle Challenger, had all been caused totally or in part by sleepy people. A horrendous number of the fatal accidents on America’s roads, especially among the young, were caused by drivers falling asleep at the wheel.
- heavy-eyed students would be sprayed awake with his trusty squirt gun and made to shout “Drowsiness is red alert!”, the motto of the cause.
