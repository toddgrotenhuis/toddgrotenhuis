## Highlights
- Challenges to this identity become highly stressful and even intolerable. The following are examples of the kinds of challenges that trigger racial stress for white people:
  Suggesting that a white person’s viewpoint comes from a racialized frame of reference (challenge to objectivity);
  People of color talking directly about their own racial perspectives (challenge to white taboos on talking openly about race);
  People of color choosing not to protect the racial feelings of white people in regards to race (challenge to white racial expectations and need/entitlement to racial comfort);
  People of color not being willing to tell their stories or answer questions about their racial experiences (challenge to the expectation that people of color will serve us);
  A fellow white not providing agreement with one’s racial perspective (challenge to white solidarity);
  Receiving feedback that one’s behavior had a racist impact (challenge to white racial innocence);
  Suggesting that group membership is significant (challenge to individualism);
  An acknowledgment that access is unequal between racial groups (challenge to meritocracy);
  Being presented with a person of color in a position of leadership (challenge to white authority);
  Being presented with information about other racial groups through, for example, movies in which people of color drive the action but are not in stereotypical roles, or multicultural education (challenge to white centrality).
- We experience a challenge to our racial worldview as a challenge to our very identities as good, moral people. It also challenges our sense of rightful place in the hierarchy. Thus, we perceive any attempt to connect us to the system of racism as a very unsettling and unfair moral offense.
- The good/bad binary is the fundamental misunderstanding driving white defensiveness about being connected to racism.
- We have not had to build tolerance for racial discomfort and thus when racial discomfort arises, whites typically respond as if something is “wrong,” and blame the person or event that triggered the discomfort (usually a person of color).
- We can begin by:
  Being willing to tolerate the discomfort associated with an honest appraisal and discussion of our internalized superiority and racial privilege.
  Challenging our own racial reality by acknowledging ourselves as racial beings with a particular and limited perspective on race.
  Attempting to understand the racial realities of people of color through authentic interaction rather than through the media or unequal relationships.
  Taking action to address our own racism, the racism of other whites, and the racism embedded in our institutions—e.g., get educated and act.
