## Highlights
- There are five types of resistant starch:
  Type 1 is found in legumes, seeds, and whole grains that cannot be digested because it is bound within the cell walls.
  Type 2 is a naturally occurring resistant starch found in some foods, such as unripe bananas, plantains, raw potatoes, Jerusalem artichokes, and lentils.
  Type 3 is produced when certain starchy foods like rice and potatoes are cooked and then cooled before eating. This type of starch is also called retrograde starch.
  Type 4 is an artificial resistant starch created using chemical processes.
  Type 5 is a starch that is classically manufactured by heating and cooling certain starches with certain fats, thereby changing their structure and making them resistant to digestion. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1399651688/15961195))
- In type 1 resistant starches, for example, the starch is physically inaccessible because it’s inside fibrous cell walls that don’t break down easily.
  Type 2 resistant starches are also naturally occurring and intrinsically resistant because of a molecular structure that’s compact and tightly packed together, limiting the access of digestive enzymes. Many forms of type 2 resistant starch contain higher amylose, which has more complex molecular surfaces that slow enzymatic digestion.
  Type 3 becomes less digestible because of molecular changes that happen as a result of heating and cooling. Inside starch, molecules are ordered in complex structures called granules. When these types of starch get heated in water, the granules swell and deform into a paste. This process is called gelatinization, and the reforming of the starch structure after cooling is called retrogradation. The extent of each of these processes affects the digestibility of the starch granules—the more “deformed” they get, the more resistant they are to digestion.
  Types 4 and 5 are made more resistant through chemical or other processing that changes the molecular structure. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1399651688/15961236))
- Research shows that when resistant starch ferments in the colon, it produces short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), such as acetate, propionate, and butyrate. Acetate, in particular, is known to inhibit the breakdown of fat tissue, so elevated levels of this short-chain fatty acid lead to a decrease in circulating free fatty acid concentrations. This is important because high circulating free fatty acid concentrations are associated with decreased insulin sensitivity. In other words, lower levels of free fatty acids mean improved insulin sensitivity. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1399651688/15961249))

- In general, resistant starch appears to be well tolerated at 45 grams per day with few gastrointestinal side effects. Eating more than can lead to uncomfortable symptoms of gas and bloating. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1399651688/15961298))
- Eat foods that naturally contain type 2 resistant starch, such as unripe bananas, plantains, legumes, oats, and cashews. Note that this type of resistant starch decreases with heating, so avoid cooking these items unless you plan on cooling them before eating (see below). Instead of cooking oatmeal, for example, make overnight oats by soaking them in milk or non-dairy milk overnight in the fridge. Also, note that once a banana ripens, the starch changes to regular starch. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1399651688/15961373))
- Heat and cool certain foods to increase resistant starch. In foods that contain type 2 and type 3 resistant starch (such as rice or potatoes), it’s the heating and subsequent cooling that changes the molecular structure to make the starch more resistant. (Once you’ve heated and cooled, reheating does not lessen resistant starch.) ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1399651688/15961374))
- Incorporate supplemental resistant starch into your food. One to two teaspoons of supplemental starch, such as potato starch or green banana flour, can be sprinkled into your food. Note that these supplements are made with type 2 resistant starch, which lessens with heat, so add it just before eating, not while cooking. Also, introduce these supplemental starches slowly into your diet to minimize potential GI distress. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1399651688/15961375))
