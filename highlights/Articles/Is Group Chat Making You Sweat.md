## Highlights
- Most things worth discussing at length are worth discussing in detail over time
- An accelerating conversation leads to shallow sound bytes and talking points — no different than talking heads on TV that only have 3 minutes to make their point before the segment ends.
- it’s fun to hook things up and pipe stuff in, but what are the costs to people’s attention? Is it worth potentially pulling them away from their work a dozen times a day (you know how people love checking unreads) just to tell them something that could have waited until later?
- Asynchronous communication is far better when working with teams spread across the world or even just a few time zones apart.
- I believe attention is one of your most precious resources. If something else controls my attention, that something else controls what I’m capable of.
- right now should be the exception, not the rule.
- there are a lot of employees out there sweating all day long trying to keep up appearances of being involved but knowing they have actual work to do
