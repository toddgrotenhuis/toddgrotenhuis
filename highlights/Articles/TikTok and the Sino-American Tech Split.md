## Highlights
- Last year Apple made over $100m of sales a day in China, while Huawei reported record revenues despite America’s campaign to cripple it.
- Judged by sales, profits and shareholder returns, it has been a golden era for American and Chinese tech. The industry now has a colossal market capitalisation of $20trn and accounts for a quarter of the world’s stockmarket value.
- American policymakers tend to assume the world will use Silicon Valley products, but plenty of countries may ally with China’s tech system or hedge their bets.
