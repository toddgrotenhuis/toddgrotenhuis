## Highlights
- The key metabolically beneficial compound in turmeric is curcumin. This chemical from the curcuminoid family gives turmeric its golden hue, but it also has potent anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. Up to about 5% of raw turmeric is curcumin. Other active ingredients include volatile oils like turmerone, atlantone, and zingiberene. Research shows that curcumin can inhibit a protein that turns on pro-inflammatory genes called NF-κB (nuclear factor kappa B). Metabolic diseases, at their core, are inflammatory diseases. Turmeric’s metabolic benefit is its ability to reduce that disease-driving inflammation.

- If you can find it, the benefit of using the fresh root is that it’s a whole food. When you take a supplement, you’re likely taking a turmeric or curcumin extract. In targeting one compound (e.g., curcumin), you may be missing out on the thousands of other potentially beneficial phytonutrients (plant chemicals) that are present in the root. You’ll also miss out on the fiber from the fresh root if you consume turmeric as a ground spice or supplement. Each form has its pros and cons. To figure out which one is right for you, think about what your goals are with taking it. For example, for overall wellness, you might go for the fresh root. For targeted pain relief, a supplement may be a good option. Also, if you’re incorporating it into food, you should know turmeric powder lends an earthy taste, and the root can be a bit bitter and peppery.
- Enhance with pepper. Curcumin isn’t well absorbed in the blood. To enhance your body’s ability to use it, pair turmeric with black pepper. Black pepper contains a chemical called piperine, which can boost the absorption of curcumin by 2,000 percent. (Pro tip: The powerful combo has also been found to improve recovery from muscle damage following intense bouts of physical activity compared to placebo.)
- Store turmeric in your freezer. Stash the whole root in a reusable freezer-safe bag and take out what you need on-demand. Or, whirl the fresh root in a food processor until it’s grated and freeze in ice cube containers. You can use frozen root in a high-powered blender, as well as cook with frozen grated turmeric.
- Feel comfortable cooking. Research shows that antioxidants remain in turmeric even after boiling or roasting. If you’re choosing a cooking method for your dish, boiling preserves antioxidants better than roasting. One idea: When cooking rice, toss in several shakes of turmeric spice into the cooking liquid.
- Use a generous amount. There’s little danger in using too much, and more provides more benefits. So when you’re adding to a smoothie—one of the most delicious ways to enjoy fresh turmeric root—you can throw in three or four inches of the fresh root without it overwhelming the drink.
- Turmeric Ideas
  Toss grated fresh or ground turmeric into curries and stir-fries. Whip up a “golden milk latte,” which is a combination of non-dairy milk along with spices, including turmeric, cinnamon, and nutmeg.
  Enhance whole grains by adding shakes of ground turmeric into the cooking water when making brown rice, farro, or quinoa. (Bonus: The spice will turn the water a beautiful yellow.)
  Warm-up with turmeric tea, which shines with fresh turmeric, a juiced lemon, and a pinch of pepper.
  Scramble eggs in turmeric. Whisk together eggs, turmeric, black pepper, and a tablespoon or two of water or coconut milk. Add mixture to the pan and stir to scramble eggs.
