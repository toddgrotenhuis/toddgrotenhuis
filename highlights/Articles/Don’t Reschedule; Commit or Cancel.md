## Highlights
- So, what do we do now that we we’ve admitted we’re not doing the thing we committed to?
  First stop and take a breath.
  Next consider why you didn’t.
  What about the activity wasn’t compelling to you enough to simply start at the designated time?
- Once you have these answers, you’ll know which of the following actions to take:
  1. Delete the activity off your calendar and completely forget about it. That’s right, your obviously not excited about this activity enough to start – so, say ‘No’ to it now and forever. Just delete it, write in what you did instead – and continue on with your day. If it likely will return, take am moment and determine who you’ll delegate it to. This is ‘When as a trigger’ that Patrick and I talk about in ‘The Power of When’ – When this task returns – I’ll delegate it to John.
  Reschedule it. If upon revisiting the significance behind the task and your reasons for not starting it this time you realize that this is still of value your punishment is to reschedule it. This punishment is felt three ways; going through the next two weeks and finding a spot for this activity you didn’t do the first time, re-evaluating and rescheduling all the other commitments in its way, and running the risk of blowing it off a second time.
  Do it with whatever amount of time remains.Yea, rescheduling it is a horrible option – you’re moving a bunch of other commitments around to squeeze in one you obviously don’t want to do in the first place. So, rather than have Future You pissed at you (again!) take this time, whatever remains, and crank it out. Complete as much of it as you can, knowing that this is all the time you have, whatever value you can create in the next 14 minutes – that’s what this commitment gets. This stress, urgency, panic, is the price you paid for committing to something you shouldn’t have. Wherever you land when time is up that’s where you land.If by some miracle you complete it – you are not the hero. You are the villain – you took a commitment you shouldn’t have, you added greater stress to your life, and you crowded out something else that far more meaningful and significant.
  Pick one.

  Rescheduling the commitment is the worst of three options.
