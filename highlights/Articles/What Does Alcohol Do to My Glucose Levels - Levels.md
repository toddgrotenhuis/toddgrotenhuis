## Highlights
- It’s thought that drinking alcohol decreases the liver’s ability to make new glucose via gluconeogenesis, which can lead to lower circulating glucose levels. To counter this decrease, alcohol stimulates the breakdown and release of stored glucose. This balance between impaired gluconeogenesis and increased glycogenolysis means that alcohol shouldn’t significantly affect glucose levels for normal, healthy individuals eating a standard diet.
  However, the situation is different for those who’ve been fasting or are in a ketogenic state because these people already have much less glucose stored as glycogen in the liver and muscles. Normally this state prompts the liver to produce new glucose via gluconeogenesis, but, as noted above, alcohol inhibits this process. The result is that glucose levels can fall to dangerously low levels and in extreme cases, this hypoglycemic state can lead to seizures, coma, or death.
