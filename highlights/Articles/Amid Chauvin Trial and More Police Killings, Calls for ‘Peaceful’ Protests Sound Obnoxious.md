- King called the newspaper’s idea of peace “an obnoxious peace.” He said, “It is the type of peace that stinks in the nostrils of the almighty God” and went on to say:
  “If peace means accepting second class citizenship, I don’t want it.”
  “If peace means keeping my mouth shut in the midst of injustice and evil, I don’t want it.”
  “If peace means being complacently adjusted to a deadening status quo, I don’t want peace.”
  “If peace means a willingness to be exploited economically, dominated politically, humiliated and segregated, I don’t want peace.” ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1405262615/16150223))
