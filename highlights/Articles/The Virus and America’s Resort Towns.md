## Highlights
- The Centres for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that African-Americans, Hispanics and Native Americans were three times likelier to be infected and five times likelier to be hospitalised than whites. Office workers with university degrees were largely spared the unemployment that low-paid service-sector workers endured. Disruption to schools is likelier to permanently damage the educational outcomes for the children of the poor than for the children of the rich. Eviction invariably conjures up images of apartment buildings, not cabins in the woods.
