## Highlights
- At this point, a second question creates another contrast in my taxonomy of political action. Specifically, should our political action be characterized by realism or revolution?
- Christian realism is the view that the kingdom of God cannot be fully realized on earth due to the fallenness of persons and institutions. So we have to be "realistic" and accept that we'll have to reconcile ourselves to political approximations of the moral goods we aspire to as Christians.
- Given this description, I'd say almost all Christian political action we see in the world today is a form of Christian realism. We use the political tools and powers available to us working toward change, election cycle after election cycle, knowing that even our preferred political outcomes will remain a far cry from the world and life God intends for us.
- In contrast to Christian realism would be a revolutionary Christian politics. The contrast goes to both the size and speed of change. Regarding the size of the change, a revolutionary politics, due to the pressing responsibility for history, will not be contented with using the politics available to us. This politics is broken beyond repair and requires immediate replacement. The political status quo has to be overthrown and replaced.  Beyond the scope and size of the demanded change, there is also the issue of time. A revolutionary politics rejects gradualism and incrementalism. The change has to happen now, in this generation.
- Now, in a taxonomy we describe Christian realism and Christian revolution as a difference of kind rather than degree. But the difference between realism and revolution is one of degree. Christians engaged in politics can vary with how patient they are with change in their lifetimes and how utopian they are in their expectations about what is politically achievable.
- Summarizing, we've now surveyed the first fork of my taxonomy. For Christians who believe they bear some moral responsibility for history, such Christians engage in politics along a continuum of action from Christian realism to revolution, with almost all of their political action, from voting to protesting, falling toward Christian realism.
