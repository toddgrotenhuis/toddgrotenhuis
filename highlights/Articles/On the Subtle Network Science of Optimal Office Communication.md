## Highlights
- Here’s a crude summary of their otherwise complex results:
  Well-connected networks, in which information flows quickly, arrive at pretty good solutions fast, but then get stuck.
  Poorly-connected networks, in which information flows slowly, arrive at much better final solutions, but it takes longer.
  This trade-off between quality of final solution and speed at which solutions are reached __can be tuned by taking a poorly-connected network and then adding more and more shortcuts to the information flows__.
