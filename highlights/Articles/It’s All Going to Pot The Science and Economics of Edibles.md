## Highlights
- GRABER: Endocannabinoids literally means the cannabinoids we produce endogenously—natively—in our own bodies, and it’s called that because we only discovered the endocannabinoid system and these native chemicals after we’d figured out what cannabinoids were in pot, and that they interacted with this system in our bodies. We only identified these receptors in the early 90s. TWILLEY: Which then helped scientists discover the homemade endogenous chemicals that trigger that same system, which previously we had no idea were there. It took cannabis to help us understand our own biology
- the endocannabinoid system is a very old system. And when I mean old, I mean evolutionarily old. It is in birds and fish and even some nematodes. It is a critical component to the way our body regulates itself. So the process of homeostasis is where you have a push and pull on a certain phenomenon like sleep. Sometimes you need to be alert. Sometimes you need to be sleepy, sometimes you need to be hungry. Sometimes you need to feel satiety. And so that push and pull, regulating that balance is called homeostasis. And pretty much wherever we have homeostasis, the endocannabinoid system has some kind of involvement
- There is a cannabinoid in black truffles and in chocolate called anandamide, but that’s it for the plant world.
- the ones that our body produces itself are very unstable. They have a very short lifetime, and they’re broken down very quickly. The ones that come from the plant are broken down much more slowly.
- The thing with opioids that makes them difficult to use is that they’re dangerous. The way that opioids kill people is by turning off respiration. So people just stop breathing. And that side effect doesn’t happen with cannabis.
- TWILLEY: When Adie or any other scientist wanted to study cannabis, they couldn’t go down to the dispensary like everyone else. They could only get it from the University of Mississippi, which grows pot for the federal government on 12 acres of heavily secured land.
  RAE: What’s really interesting about that product is that it is in no way similar to the cannabis that is found in regulated markets worldwide. So there was a really beautiful paper that came out in around 2017, which did this really fancy mathematical analysis, principal components analysis. And they showed that that product is chemically distinct from every other product that humans are using. So not only do we have no money, and we have one source of cannabis for research purposes, but that “cannabis” is chemically dissimilar from all other cannabis on the planet.
- GRABER: But that changed literally this past May, because now more companies are licensed to grow different cannabis plants for science. And as for funding, now scientists can also study the health effects, too, not just the harm.
- researchers can’t just assume that if they study the effects of smoking cannabis, that the same will be true if you eat it. In fact, they’re different.
- they’re different because the liver does stuff. It turns THC into a different form of THC, one that’s 20 times more potent.
- And also that particular molecule sticks around for a long time. It doesn’t break down as quickly as the THC that gets directly into your blood from smoking, it just hangs on and keeps firing up your brain. So you feel high for a lot longer, too.
- When your liver processes CBD, the chemical almost disappears.
- For THC, when you swallow, you know, a certain amount you have a certain amount bioavailable. CBD oral bioavailability is much lower, as low as 5%. So if you’re taking you know, like a 100 milligram you know, CBD capsule or something, you might get five milligrams into your bloodstream. And that’s a whopping dose, right? A hundred.
- GRABER: Adie says there is some evidence that CBD does build up in your body.
  RAE: So if you take 35 to 50 milligrams of oral CBD every single day, it will accumulate in your blood and there will be probably some anti inflammatory, anti oxidative, potentially anxiety relieving effect of that bio accumulation
- That said, there are other ways to get CBD into your body that don’t go through your liver—you can put it on your skin, you can put a tincture under your tongue, those both get it right to your blood and muscles. You can obviously also smoke CBD.
- Another thing we know for sure is the younger you start using THC, the more likely it is that it’s going to have long lasting negative impacts. So you know, we have tons and tons of data out there showing us that it is a very bad idea to put THC in your brain before it’s done developing, which is about the age 21, 22.
