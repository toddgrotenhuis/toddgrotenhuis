## Highlights
- Something all three of these societies share in common, and a large reason why they’ve been so successful in doing away with the police, is that they have also done away with their hierarchical, authoritarian forms of government and replaced them with directly democratic systems of governance.

- Of course citizens break agreements less when they can meaningfully help craft what those agreements are and when they have less of a need to break them. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1407348187/16212088))
- Police aren’t designed to prevent crime; they react to crime with threats and acts of violence, protecting a system that benefits off the poverty that fuels crime. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1407348187/16212089))
- These societies aren’t utopias. While they’re genuinely exploring the root causes of social and domestic conflicts, people still act in ways that are harmful to each other and their community. While they don’t have policing institutions, they do still have a need to provide the two main services we assume the police provide: protecting the community from outside threats and the enforcement of the community’s agreements when necessary.

- Here are a few ways these community defense forces are different from police:
  • They are made of up people from the communities they serve and are accountable to those communities. Processes to recall people serving on these forces are provided and used.
  • They’re volunteer based rather than professionalized. People serving on the forces rotate so that more members of the community gain skills and experience being responsible for the community’s safety.
  • They enforce agreements made by the community through consensus, not laws that are made by some people to serve their own interests.
  These forces are also complemented by accountability structures whose goal is to administer transformative rather than punitive justice when community agreements are violated. Because the enforcement of agreements and the repercussions of the violation of agreements are so intertwined, these communities’ alternatives to our criminal courts and prison systems are touched on in this resource.
