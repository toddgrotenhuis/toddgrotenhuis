## Highlights
- The issue here is one of spiritual formation and political resistance. When things get hard and sacrificial, like being sent to a Nazi concentration camp, willpower is just too anemic a resource to reliably guide you to the light. Political resistance isn't a snap decision, it's a product of spiritual formation, habits of identity, thinking, and behavior so deeply ingrained that when the hurricane winds start to blow you're so deeply grounded and rooted you're able to stay upright. Add to this how, when a community stands collectively together, it makes it easier for members of the group to stand. We help each other resist.

- We all want to be Dietrich Bonhoeffer, but never put in the work. We're such huge hypocrites. I've spoken in hundreds of churches, and I've never been in a church that has devoted a part of its mission to spiritually forming its people for political resistance.

- What's your list? What is your church doing by way of spiritual formation that would enable your political resistance to the siren songs of nationalism and patriotism? To be clear, I'm not talking about what sorts of sermons you preach or hear in your church. I'm talking about political habits. Let me spell it out: P-o-l-i-t-i-c-a-l h-a-b-i-t-s. Make a list of those habits. Show us some action or behavior that demonstrates some degree of political nonconformity. How your church is politically weird, even offensive. Show us some practiced habit that instills in your people the capacity to give a political "No!" to the nation when your neighbors are waving the flag and screaming "Yes!"
