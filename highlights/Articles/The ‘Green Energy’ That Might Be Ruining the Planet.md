## Highlights
- the European experience shows that general policies to promote renewables can spark a massive shift to wood-burning if biomass isn’t specifically excluded. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1399633770/15966446))
- Trees are the best available technology for capturing the carbon that’s frying the planet, but that works only while they’re alive and growing. Burning trees, on the other hand, sends all that carbon up in smoke. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1399633770/15966473))
- much of the wood that gets pelletized isn’t unmerchantable waste wood. It’s pulpwood—whole pine and hardwood trees as well as wood chips that could otherwise be sold to paper mills. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1399633770/15966506))
- Even if new trees are planted in their place, many studies suggest they will take decades, and in some cases centuries, to absorb enough carbon to “pay back” the carbon debt from burning the older trees. That’s a problem, because scientists don’t believe the world can wait decades, much less centuries, to cut emissions. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1399633770/15966510))
- the reason Americans recycle their paper and cardboard instead of incinerating it is to help save pulpwood. They probably don’t think they’re saving trees so they can be logged, crushed, shipped across the Atlantic and incinerated in Europe.

- The rapid growth of biomass power over the past decade is in part a story about the unintended consequences of the arcane accounting rules that countries use to track their progress toward global climate goals. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1399633770/15966517))
- Just because biomass is renewable doesn’t mean that it’s better for the climate. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1399633770/15966521))
- And in the future, burning and replanting trees could actually reduce emissions if the carbon from the burning is captured at the power plant, a technology known as BECCS—shorthand for “bioenergy with carbon capture and storage” ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1399633770/15966543))
- The South is America’s “wood basket,” just as the Midwest is America’s breadbasket ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1399633770/15966544))
- U.S. pellet mills have often been located in predominantly minority communities, which has added an environmental justice angle to the politics of biomass. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1399633770/15968415))
- The environmental justice case against the pellet industry has never gained much traction; no mill has ever been denied a permit ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1399633770/15968464))
- agricultural expansion is the largest driver of deforestation ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1399633770/15968489))
- as hundreds of millions of people join the middle class in countries like India and China, larger portions of their diets will consist of meat, which is the most land-intensive food; the World Resources Institute projects that unless current trends in population or meat-eating change, the world will have to deforest a land mass nearly twice the size of India by 2050 ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1399633770/15968492))
- forestry interests have a lot of clout in Washington, and stipulating that biomass is carbon-neutral makes emissions reductions much easier to achieve on paper. The European experience has shown that when biomass is considered carbon-neutral in a carbon-constrained economy, power plants start burning a lot of biomass.
