## Highlights
- This is not the only virtue system, however: Every group has one, implicitly or explicitly, and in some cases there are striking differences among them. What is a virtue in some communities might be a vice in others.
- Other times, competing virtue systems will use the same term but understand radically different things by it.
- Celebrity is a major telos of contemporary Western society, and I think we’ll understand how radically it departs from the Christian understanding of the good if we examine the virtues it presupposes.
- Having, predictably enough, failed to become a god, the modern artist falls into the hands of the market, the unstoppable forces of consumer capitalism—and ultimately stops being even an artist. His art becomes a status symbol for the rich
- Really I suspect that the problem is not celebrity itself, but ambition and the worship of success in all its forms; celebrity is a mere subcategory
- Our task must be to focus on the work and its internal goods, and on the kingdom of heaven that all our actions are meant to serve, rather than on the reception of our work
