## Highlights
- anarchism is to Marxism-Leninism what Anabaptism was to the magisterial Reformation: a revolutionary movement predicated upon negating, rather than seizing control of, state power. ([Location 145](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008F0CH5S&location=145))

- With Ellul, I think that anarchism deserves to be reconsidered, particularly by Christians, and even more particularly by contemporary Anabaptists. ([Location 150](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008F0CH5S&location=150))
- Jesus’ reign isn’t other-worldly. It isn’t apolitical. It’s just political in a radically different way. ([Location 177](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008F0CH5S&location=177))

- The kingdom of God that Jesus announced and embodied is what life would be like on earth, here and now, if God were king and the rulers of this world were not. ([Location 194](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008F0CH5S&location=194))
- Since Jesus is (as Christians believe) the truest revelation of God, then he defines for us what the reign of God looks like. ([Location 200](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008F0CH5S&location=200))
- Most anarchists (rightfully) reject such “anarcho-capitalists” as not anarchist at all. ([Location 240](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008F0CH5S&location=240))
    - Note: As with anarchism, freed-market anarchism is not monolithic and oft-misunderstood. There are certain types that fit Mark's definition, and others that I think are truer and better from perspectives of nonviolence and sustainability.
- It is clear that in its earliest centuries, the Church rejected the religion, economics, and violence of empire. Often, Christians saw themselves as a distinct socio-political reality which, while not necessarily anarchistic, certainly had many similar components.

- We read Scripture in ways that support authoritarianism because we learned how to read Scripture in authoritarian contexts. ([Location 663](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008F0CH5S&location=663))
- Many Christians have mistakenly assumed, based upon Jesus’ life and teachings, that everything we usually identify as “violent” is off-limits. Yet clearly, Jesus engaged in such things as property destruction, verbal abuse, and civil disobedience. Rather than developing an absolutist code, we should engage Scripture in the midst of the practice of communal discernment in particular contexts and let things develop from there. ([Location 853](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008F0CH5S&location=853))
- And there are those who see Christianity as a useful tool on one’s journey towards anarchism. They see anti-domination as their true god, and even Christ serves to bring people to this god. The danger of this temptation is that anything sacred becomes scrapped for parts to a cause that will never arrive. ([Location 930](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008F0CH5S&location=930))
- Christianity not only injected some of its DNA into Empire (thus Christianizing empire), but empire has injected its DNA into Christianity, thus imperializing our Christianity. It is almost impossible to understand how deep the infection goes. ([Location 952](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008F0CH5S&location=952))
- Christo-anarchism refers not only to the insight that Jesus’ vision of the [un]Kingdom of God has anarchic (anti-domination) implications, but also the assumption that, only by nurturing practices centered on the presence of the Living Christ, can we move from domination to non-domination, from death to life, from oppression to liberation, and from alienation to love. ([Location 985](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008F0CH5S&location=985))
- We need practices that help us learn the way of Jesus, not just practices that help us implement the way of Jesus. ([Location 1015](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008F0CH5S&location=1015))
- We need to tell the stories of the places in which we live from the vantage point of the oppressed. ([Location 1031](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008F0CH5S&location=1031))
- We need to honestly tell the story of how we relate to the places in which we live. ([Location 1039](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008F0CH5S&location=1039))
- We need to experiment towards a gift economy. ([Location 1045](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008F0CH5S&location=1045))
- We should develop practices of silence and communal discernment. ([Location 1052](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008F0CH5S&location=1052))
- We need to listen to the Holy Spirit, rather than simply reading about how the Holy Spirit communicated to dead Apostles. ([Location 1056](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008F0CH5S&location=1056))
- We must enter into real relationships with the marginalized. And if we consider ourselves among the marginalized, we should develop relationships with other marginalized people in our places. ([Location 1059](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008F0CH5S&location=1059))
