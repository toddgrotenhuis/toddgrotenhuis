## Highlights
- far too often the language of spiritual warfare has been used to demonize other human beings. ([Location 138](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GOZRQ42&location=138))
- The trouble with the Devil is that we see him in the faces of those we hate, justifying our violence toward them. ([Location 139](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GOZRQ42&location=139))
- the Devil has been used to scapegoat despised and marginalized groups. ([Location 140](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GOZRQ42&location=140))
- In the hands of many doubting and disenchanted Christians, spiritual warfare—battling against the forces of darkness in the world—is synonymous with social justice. ([Location 160](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GOZRQ42&location=160))
- when you struggle with doubts and disenchantment concerning the supernatural, your faith becomes focused upon the world you can see and touch, the earth and all her inhabitants. ([Location 236](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GOZRQ42&location=236))
- By increasing our focus on the material earth, rather than on unseen heaven, doubt and disenchantment push us toward more ecologically and socially conscious expressions of faith. ([Location 237](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GOZRQ42&location=237))
- In the Bible, Satan and the Devil are interchangeable names for the personification of all that is adversarial to the kingdom and people of God, the personified Enemy of God. ([Location 287](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GOZRQ42&location=287))
- Biblically, Satan names that which is working against God and God’s kingdom in the world. ([Location 292](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GOZRQ42&location=292))
- In this book, “spiritual warfare” is shorthand for the Christ-shaped pushback against all the forces in the world working antagonistically against the kingdom of God. ([Location 296](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GOZRQ42&location=296))
- Why can’t we just focus on the positive? Because positive doesn’t have any meaning without its relationship to something negative. ([Location 313](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GOZRQ42&location=313))
- Hate is the satan of love. Exclusion is the satan of inclusion. War is the satan of peace. Oppression is the satan of justice. Tearing down is the satan of building up. Competition is the satan of cooperation. Revenge is the satan of mercy. Harm is the satan of care. Hostility is the satan of reconciliation. There is a satan to the kingdom of God. ([Location 321](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GOZRQ42&location=321))
- Unlike us, Jesus never takes the bait, never becomes Satan to fight Satan. ([Location 330](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GOZRQ42&location=330))

- We encounter beauty and ugliness, love and meaning. We are skeptics, but we are also haunted by the sense that there is something more. ([Location 395](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GOZRQ42&location=395))
- When reading a Bible story, we perform a Scooby-Dooification when we look past the spooky and supernatural covering to expose the human element at the core of the story. ([Location 438](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GOZRQ42&location=438))
- when we focus on the human element, our vision of spiritual warfare becomes more and more about social justice. ([Location 459](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GOZRQ42&location=459))
- In the Bible, spiritual warfare is regularly tied up with political and economic exploitation. ([Location 463](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GOZRQ42&location=463))
- When Jesus talks about conflict with “principalities and powers,” he’s talking about conflict with legal and political authorities. The Gospel describes conflict with “principalities and powers” as being arrested for disturbing the peace. ([Location 484](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GOZRQ42&location=484))
- Are the powers being referred to in the passage human political powers, spiritual powers, or a mix of both? ([Location 488](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GOZRQ42&location=488))
- When Luke and Paul write about principalities and powers, they’re talking about a mixture of human and spiritual powers. ([Location 510](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GOZRQ42&location=510))
- The reason the Bible mixes and matches human and spiritual powers is because the writers of the Bible didn’t think these were different sorts of powers. ([Location 511](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GOZRQ42&location=511))
- In the Exodus, the political struggle on earth was also a spiritual struggle in the heavens. For the ancients, justice always had a spiritual aspect. ([Location 519](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GOZRQ42&location=519))
- If you’ve tended to think of spiritual warfare as mainly about how our prayers give aid and strength to protective angels fighting off aggressive demons, I challenge you to expand how you think about spiritual warfare, because in the Bible spiritual conflict is intimately associated with political struggle. So I hope this insight leads you to explore a more politically and socially engaged vision of spiritual warfare. But if you’ve already adopted this socially and politically engaged vision of spiritual warfare, I want you to expand your vision, too. For one thing, Jesus wasn’t much of a political activist. When Jesus described the battle he was fighting, he talked more about Satan than about Caesar. And when spiritual warfare is reduced to political struggle it’s tempted toward violence. For example, as we work for justice in the world, feelings can run hot; we’re often tempted toward bitterness and hatred when we face the people we’ve identified as the cause of the problem. So if Jesus was an activist, he was an activist who preached “love your enemies” and “bless those who curse you.” And that battle—the deep spiritual struggle to extend love, mercy, and grace for our enemies—must accompany any vision of Christian activism. Spiritual warfare isn’t just political engagement, it’s also a journey toward love. ([Location 538](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GOZRQ42&location=538))

- A narrow focus on political activism often ignores important conversations about personal morality and holiness. ([Location 548](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GOZRQ42&location=548))
- There’s a sad irony here, how a compassionate faith places a heavy burden upon our faith. ([Location 556](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GOZRQ42&location=556))
- If doubting and social justice–minded Christians love anything about Christianity, they love Jesus. ([Location 597](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GOZRQ42&location=597))
- Jesus went about doing good and healing all who were under the power of the devil. Christians who love the radical welcoming Jesus have emphasized the first part of this description—Jesus going around and doing good—but, in good Thomas Jefferson fashion, they’ve ignored the second part—Jesus overcoming the “power of the devil” ([Location 605](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GOZRQ42&location=605))
- By driving out the Prince of this World Jesus declares that the kingdom of God has been inaugurated on earth. And as the kingdom expands, Jesus’ followers report that they too have power over Satan! ([Location 642](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GOZRQ42&location=642))
- We prefer to see Jesus as a moral teacher, especially when he calls out corrupt religious, political, and economic institutions. But if you excise the dramatic clash between Jesus and the Devil you eliminate the narrative glue that holds the Gospels together as a coherent story. If we want to understand what Jesus was up to in the world, we’ve got to confront his conflict with Satan and acknowledge how central that plotline is to the story being told in the Gospels. ([Location 653](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GOZRQ42&location=653))
- Jesus was in a battle with Satan, and if we want to follow Jesus we have to fight the battle that Jesus fought. This seems a rather obvious point, but with all the mental snipping going on, due to our doubts and disenchantment, this point is often missed. Jesus was picking a fight. Followers of Jesus have to pick that same fight. ([Location 672](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GOZRQ42&location=672))
- when it comes to Jesus’ battle with Satan, both conservative and progressive Christians snip out critical parts of the conflict. With their focus on traditional family values, the Protestant work ethic, and “God and Country” patriotism, conservative Christians snip out the Jesus who marginalized the family, who was a friend of sinners, who sided with the poor against the rich, and who was executed by the state for sedition. Snip. Snip. Snip. Progressive Christians snip out different stuff. We’re aware that Jesus was executed by the state but fail notice that Jesus’ battle with the Satan didn’t look a whole lot like what we’d describe as political activism. Jesus lived under empire, one of the most exploitative and oppressive in world history. And yet, Jesus never led a protest against Roman occupation. Jesus didn’t lead a “March on Rome” or carry a sign through downtown Jerusalem protesting Roman oppression. Jesus’ one disruptive action, clearing the Temple, was the restoration of a house of worship so that it could be a house of prayer. And most worryingly, Jesus was routinely gracious to the colonial occupiers and agents of empire like tax collectors and Roman centurions, to say nothing of telling his oppressed countrymen to “love your enemies.” We’ve failed to grasp the exact nature of Jesus’ provocation because of all the snipping that’s been going on. With Old Scratch snipped out of the Gospels, we’ve lost track of what Jesus was up to and why he was killed. ([Location 676](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GOZRQ42&location=676))

- If we want to avoid Swiss Cheese Jesus we have to grasp how Jesus’ kingdom proclamation was deeply political and deeply spiritual. ([Location 688](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GOZRQ42&location=688))

    - Note: He also threatened Rome with its obsolescence. Where are the planks in our own eyes?
- Jesus’ conflict with Rome—and the empire of any age—wasn’t a direct political confrontation but involved the establishment a kingdom that was and is a rival location of human flourishing that affects every aspect of life—spiritual, moral, social, and even political. Jesus’ conflict with the Satan was the struggle to establish God’s rule across all these intersecting spheres, the ways in which political oppression is wrapped up in spiritual and moral bondage. ([Location 693](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GOZRQ42&location=693))
- for penal substitutionary atonement to work, God has to be your problem. In penal substitutionary atonement, Jesus is saving you from the wrath of God. ([Location 758](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GOZRQ42&location=758))
- In contrast to Jesus—the Jesus who is the “exact representation” of God (Hebrews 1:3)—the God of penal substitutionary atonement seems violently intolerant of sin. These two visions of God just don’t fit together. Can’t and won’t fit together. Something is wrong. ([Location 764](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GOZRQ42&location=764))
- the good news of Jesus’ death actually has to be good news. Not bad news first and good news second. ([Location 779](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GOZRQ42&location=779))
- According to Christus Victor, humanity and the entire created order is in oppressive bondage to a variety of cosmic forces, including sin and death, forces the Devil uses to keep us separated from God. In response to our bondage to these powers, Jesus is born into the world to liberate us and set us free. Jesus rescues us from enslavement to hostile spiritual forces rather than from the wrath and judgment of God. ([Location 788](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GOZRQ42&location=788))
- Christus Victor requires a theology of spiritual warfare, a vision of spiritual enslavement. ([Location 828](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GOZRQ42&location=828))
- Christus Victor theology doesn’t require a belief in a literal, personal Devil, but at minimum you have to believe that humans are enslaved or trapped by oppressive spiritual forces, because the core idea of Christus Victor atonement is the belief that God is acting in Jesus as a liberator, emancipator, and rescuer. And if God in Jesus is engaged in a Great Rescue Operation, we have to assume a prior condition in which we experienced spiritual slavery and oppression. ([Location 832](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GOZRQ42&location=832))
- Fighting evil in the world is like Hercules fighting the Hydra: cut off one head and two come back in its place. Political oppression doesn’t just drop out of the sky. To think you can talk about the Holocaust or human sex trafficking and avoid a conversation about sin and wickedness is naïve. And dangerous. You have to attend to the spiritual darkness at work in the background. ([Location 846](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GOZRQ42&location=846))
- My faith had become philosophy, a collection of ideas to kick around with other smart people in a coffeeshop or pub. ([Location 879](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GOZRQ42&location=879))
- I use the word enthusiastic deliberately, for it comes from the Greek root entheos (literally en “in” + theos “God”), meaning to be filled by God. An enthusiastic Christian is a Christian who has been filled by God. ([Location 885](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GOZRQ42&location=885))
- charismatic Christianity has always been the spirituality of the persecuted and the oppressed— enchanted, charismatic spirituality is the Christianity of the margins. ([Location 905](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GOZRQ42&location=905))
- But here’s the irony: A disenchanted, politicized, and progressive vision of spiritual warfare drew me to the margins and there, once I found myself on the margins, I clashed with the enchanted, enthusiastic, and charismatic spirituality I encountered. ([Location 927](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GOZRQ42&location=927))
- Long ago, when it came to public shaming, you wore a scarlet letter. Today, it’s a hashtag that goes viral. ([Location 994](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GOZRQ42&location=994))
- Critics of spiritual warfare have got it backwards when they say that talking about demons will cause you to demonize other human beings. The truth is that it’s the exact opposite: it’s our refusal to talk about demons that causes us to demonize other human beings. ([Location 1010](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GOZRQ42&location=1010))
- If there isn’t a spiritual dynamic at work in the struggle, if the struggle for social justice is thoroughly disenchanted, then it’s destined to be a battle against other human beings, against the Bad People—the Good People trying to wrest power away from the Bad People. ([Location 1013](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GOZRQ42&location=1013))

- I think that’s why our political discourse has become so hostile and violent: spiritual virtues and weapons such as confession, self-control, repentance, humility, peacemaking, forgiveness, joy, mercy, and love have all gone missing. ([Location 1021](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GOZRQ42&location=1021))
- If our political struggle for justice is to resist the temptations toward dehumanization and hatred, it must be accompanied by this deeper spiritual struggle to love our enemies. ([Location 1042](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GOZRQ42&location=1042))
- But this is hard work, because when you care passionately about injustice you’re going to get angry. And if we’re also loving our enemies, where are we going to direct that anger? ([Location 1044](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GOZRQ42&location=1044))
- And that trick is spiritual warfare. Spiritual warfare energizes your anger but lovingly redirects that anger away from human beings and toward a common enemy. ([Location 1049](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GOZRQ42&location=1049))
- Jesus finds mercy for those who killed him because he saw them as leaves being blown about by violent winds—political, social, cultural, psychological, and historical winds. ([Location 1053](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GOZRQ42&location=1053))
- We can see oppressors as human beings, as vulnerable to evil the same way I am vulnerable to evil. Our battles for justice can be focused upon the unseen satanic aspect rather than upon the flesh and blood of human beings. ([Location 1100](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GOZRQ42&location=1100))
- what Jesus did do—and the early church followed his lead—was to create a community characterized by two things: the practices of care and peace. ([Location 1167](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GOZRQ42&location=1167))
- The church is a laboratory of love, a place where material care, sharing, hospitality, and mutual honoring are practiced and lived out. ([Location 1185](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GOZRQ42&location=1185))
- Repeatedly, the Bible tells us that the church is the place where we come together to practice care and peace. The church is a laboratory of love and reconciliation, a workshop of sharing and forgiving, a testing ground of mercy and grace. ([Location 1204](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GOZRQ42&location=1204))
- The church is the laboratory of care and peace where you can’t get away with loving humanity abstractly and theoretically. You have to practice care and peace with the person standing right in front of you, the person boring you or annoying you as you’re sipping bad coffee together. ([Location 1208](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GOZRQ42&location=1208))
- It’s much easier to love people in the abstract than to love actual human beings. But that’s what the church gives you: actual human beings. ([Location 1213](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GOZRQ42&location=1213))
- Compassion is what draws us to Jesus and to the suffering of the world. But the pain we encounter there places an enormous burden upon our faith. ([Location 1333](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GOZRQ42&location=1333))
- It’s hard to believe when your heart gets broken, broken over and over again by the pain of the world. ([Location 1335](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GOZRQ42&location=1335))
- Suffering exists and we must act—that’s the starting point. ([Location 1345](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GOZRQ42&location=1345))
- the existence of evil doesn’t seem to pose any theological problem in the Bible—not in the Old Testament, not for Jesus in the Gospels, and not for the early church. ([Location 1347](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GOZRQ42&location=1347))
- The only theodicy we find in the Bible is resistance. A theology of revolt trades in philosophical bafflement for boots on the ground. ([Location 1352](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GOZRQ42&location=1352))
- I could sit around debating the problem of evil or I could do the dishes. ([Location 1365](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GOZRQ42&location=1365))
- The world is suffering. And in the face of that suffering Jesus went about doing good and healing all those under the power of the devil. ([Location 1369](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GOZRQ42&location=1369))
- God is at war. And it’s time for us to join the fight. ([Location 1370](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GOZRQ42&location=1370))
- We need a cleareyed assessment of what goes wrong with Christians who begin to use God as a weapon against others. ([Location 1391](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GOZRQ42&location=1391))
- Love the Lord your God, that was the prime directive. But some questions needed answering. Yes, love the Lord, but what does this love entail? How is this love practiced? How are we to love the Lord? These were questions that were hotly debated by the rabbis. Jesus entered this contentious debate by appending another commandment to the Shema. ([Location 1401](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GOZRQ42&location=1401))
- In addition to the Shema (Deuteronomy 6:4-5) Jesus adds Leviticus 19:18: “Love your neighbor as yourself.” These two we call the “Greatest Commandments”—according to Jesus, loving God is conflated and mixed up with loving human beings. ([Location 1408](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GOZRQ42&location=1408))
- Christians disagree about how we are to mix and balance these commands to love God and our neighbors: ([Location 1412](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GOZRQ42&location=1412))
- Whenever you hear someone say that they love God more than human beings watch out, because that person is about to hurt somebody. In the name of God they are planning to hurt somebody. That’s the inherent danger of the Two Loves view of the Greatest Commandments, ([Location 1417](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GOZRQ42&location=1417))
- But in contrast to this Two Loves view is the One Love view, that there’s only one love at work in the greatest commandments. In this view, Jesus isn’t quoting Leviticus 19:18 to bring a second love alongside the love of God, he’s quoting Leviticus 19:18 to specify what loving God consists of. Leviticus 19:18 interprets Deuteronomy 6:4-5—the two passages are woven together to make one point: loving human beings is loving God and loving God is loving human beings. Only one love is at work, with no daylight between these two objects of love. Consequently, there is no conflict between loving God and loving people. ([Location 1424](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GOZRQ42&location=1424))
- According to the One Love view, loving our neighbors is the complete and full expression of what it means to love God. ([Location 1432](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GOZRQ42&location=1432))
- To love God, Jesus said, is to love your neighbor as yourself. Full stop. Everything about spiritual warfare flows out of that basic understanding. ([Location 1442](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GOZRQ42&location=1442))
- importantly, this image of the demonic can never be used to harm or hurt human beings. ([Location 1445](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GOZRQ42&location=1445))
- every follower of Jesus faces this same choice, the choice Peter put before Jesus. The choice is between Satan and the cross. That’s the fork in the road. ([Location 1464](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GOZRQ42&location=1464))
- The satanic is everything which tempts us away from taking up our cross in following Jesus. This is critical for a theology of spiritual warfare, as the cross of Jesus is the quintessential expression of self-giving, self-donating, and sacrificial love. The satanic and the demonic are all those forces tempting us away from this love. ([Location 1466](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GOZRQ42&location=1466))

- And by the satanic, I mean all that is opposed or adversarial to love, all that is opposed to the cross. ([Location 1470](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GOZRQ42&location=1470))

- There are forces in the world satanically opposed to love. So if love is going to invade and establish a beachhead in our lives we’re going to have to fight for it. ([Location 1533](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GOZRQ42&location=1533))
- Christ’s victory over Satan is won through sacrificial love. The Lion triumphs in battle as the Lamb. And in its own battle with Satan the church militant uses the same weapon—the blood of the Lamb, sacrificial love. ([Location 1551](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GOZRQ42&location=1551))
- The War of the Lamb—the battle for love fought with love—is a battle fought by soldiers who are willing to have their blood shed rather than shed the blood of their enemies. ([Location 1561](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GOZRQ42&location=1561))
- maybe love means you have to give up some vision of worldly success. ([Location 1583](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GOZRQ42&location=1583))
- Living out the Beatitudes in a maximum-security prison? Getting jumped so bad by a gang that your eyeball is knocked out of its socket? Giving up a prestigious position to teach history in an innercity school? That’s the foolishness of the cross. But that is how the battle with Satan is fought and won. A battle fought for love with love. That is the War of the Lamb. ([Location 1599](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GOZRQ42&location=1599))
- Eichmann did what he did because he loved his country, because he trusted his superiors, because he never questioned their orders, because he went to work each day and did his job. He was a small cog in a much larger machine, not one to speak up to power. Arendt coined the term “the banality of evil” to describe Eichmann’s self-defense, a defense rooted in an unthinking patriotism, deference to authority, and focus on just doing his job. ([Location 1627](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GOZRQ42&location=1627))
- Evil, according to Arendt, is unthinking assent to the values, norms, and expectations of our world and the institutions we work and serve within, informal and formal, large and small. Evil is unthinking conformity to the Zeitgeist, ([Location 1633](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GOZRQ42&location=1633))
- we fail to question the Zeitgeist of our own time and place. ([Location 1638](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GOZRQ42&location=1638))
- Discerning the spirits in the world at work within cultures, systems, nations, and institutions—spiritually assessing how we might be “drinking the Kool Aid”—involves determining if the spirit, Zeitgeist, culture, value system, way-of-life, or ideology at work is satanically adversarial to the cross. Discerning the spirits is testing to see if the Zeitgeists we encounter in any given context are pro-Jesus or anti-Jesus. Because when we fail to tests the spirits we become accomplices, like an Eichmann, of the anti-Jesus forces at work in the world. And we aid and abet without any malice or forethought. Because we really haven’t given it any thought at all. We’ve just drunk the Kool Aid. ([Location 1642](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GOZRQ42&location=1642))
- Doubting and disenchanted Christians need to recover a way of speaking about angels and demons because the language of discerning the spirits helps us shift focus away from concrete examples of oppression to attend to the Zeitgeist that produces these injustices.

- Political activism is largely impotent in addressing the spiritual problems facing America and the world. A new president or a new Congress isn’t going to heal what ails us.

- The reign of God on earth is thus both political and spiritual, involving the worship of God and the restoration of justice.

- All through the Bible a failure to show spiritual allegiance to God goes hand in hand with political oppression. This highlights how spiritual warfare can be described as a battle between rival spiritual allegiances, allegiances that bring either peace or oppression to earth.

- That diabolical connection—demons associated with the political kingdoms of the world—is highlighted right at the start of the New Testament. In the temptation narratives in the Gospels, Satan is described as ruler over all the kingdoms in the world: The devil led him up to a high place and showed him in an instant all the kingdoms of the world. And he said to him, “I will give you all their authority and splendor; it has been given to me, and I can give it to anyone I want to.” (Luke 4:5-6) I don’t think the connection between the spiritual and the political could be any clearer. The price for political power is spiritual allegiance. Jesus rejects both offers, refusing to worship Satan and refusing to rule the world through political power. Turning his back on Satan, Jesus sets out to establish a very different sort of kingdom exercising a very different sort of power as a very different sort of King. ([Location 1763](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GOZRQ42&location=1763))

- Every organization or institution has an Outside and an Inside. And while our conversation about Zeitgeists in this chapter has mainly been about nation-states, every organization and group has a Zeitgeist, an inner spiritual climate that affects those within the institution.

- But here’s the weird thing. A lot of Christians are embarrassed by sin. We don’t want to talk about it. Especially when it comes to sex. You see this embarrassment a lot among Christians who are post-evangelical or post-fundamentalist, Christians who were raised in puritanical churches where sin, holiness, purity, piety, and personal morality were talked about all the time in ways that created loads of guilt, fear, and shame. I understand. Growing up in a conservative church I knew that being a “good person” meant avoiding drugs and sex. And coming out of pietistic churches like this we want to avoid talking about sin because talking about sin makes you sound like a judgmental and holier-than-thou Christian who’s obsessed with sex. The other hesitancy to talk about personal morality has to do with how we need to address systemic evils—social injustice and oppression. By focusing so much on this struggle we can come to wholly ignore the personal and moral aspects of the Christian walk. We talk a lot about justice, but we have almost nothing to say about holiness. ([Location 1880](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GOZRQ42&location=1880))
- Holiness is one of the things that gets lost when we stop talking about the Devil. We miss how spiritual warfare is often a personal, private, and intimate battle against our own inner demons. ([Location 1896](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GOZRQ42&location=1896))

- The Bible has always linked sex to covenant rather than consent because the writers of the Bible understood that sex is political, relational, and social. Consent is contractual, two isolated individuals negotiating and then reaching an agreement about a sexual transaction. Consent is the child of capitalism. Covenant, by contrast, is a promise to care for and protect, tonight, and more importantly, tomorrow. The problem with consent is that while we might voluntarily agree to a sexual transaction, and this does protect us from rape and abuse, we might be radically unprepared for how the experience will leave each of us exposed, vulnerable, and needy in ways we hadn’t anticipated. Covenant is the promise to care about these exposures, vulnerabilities, and needs. ([Location 1987](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GOZRQ42&location=1987))

- As Jesus sees it, holiness provides us with a suit of armor that we need out in the world. Holiness equips us to be missional people. Once again this flips our typical associations with holiness.

- Our theology of spiritual warfare must give an account of the world and how it is regularly described as the domain and kingdom of Satan. Spiritual warfare means stepping out of the world and into the kingdom of God. ([Location 2113](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GOZRQ42&location=2113))
- If following Jesus is fundamentally an act of nonconformity to the world, you need to have a clear sense about what conformity to the world looks like. If the kingdom of God is an act of rebellion, you need to know what you’re rebelling against. Otherwise you’re just walking in circles. This is what it means when Jesus described the Devil as the Prince of the World (John 12:21; 14:40). When we invoke the Devil we are tracing out the pattern of this world so that we can resist conformity to that pattern. Over and over in the Gospels, Jesus describes and illustrates the pattern of the kingdom of God and how it differs from the pattern of this world. ([Location 2119](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GOZRQ42&location=2119))
- First, you can’t make a power grab in the kingdom of God. And second, because you can’t make a power grab in the kingdom of heaven it’s pointless to get upset about others trying to make a power grab. ([Location 2131](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GOZRQ42&location=2131))
- Spiritual warfare must focus on how unjust power structures— the principalities and powers—harm and oppress others, especially the most vulnerable among us. So we resist the powers and principalities when they act as playground bullies, lording over others. But as we see in the Gospel stories, we’re not immune to the allure of power. We’re all tempted to be assholes. Craving to be the boss. Desiring to climb the ladder. Jealous to call the shots. Pushing to stand in the position of influence. On social media we crave more followers, more clicks and bigger platforms. Bigger speaking gigs, a book deal, a church with a bigger congregation, a better title on the business card, a more prestigious college for our kids to attend. We’re all tempted to climb. Because, come on, admit it, don’t you think the world would be a better place if you were in charge and everyone did as you told them to? And isn’t that exactly the temptation Satan offered Jesus? Our battle with the principalities and powers isn’t just a battle waged out in the world, at locations of political and economic bullying. It’s also a deeply personal and spiritual battle, a battle in our own hearts and minds to resist the allure of lording over in our own personal spheres of influence. ([Location 2147](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GOZRQ42&location=2147))
- Power Breeds Satans As Bob Sutton points out, assholes are created because we are all so easily corrupted by hierarchy and asymmetries in power.

- Combining the Greek words kenosis (“emptying”) from Philippians 2 and arche (“rule”), kenarchy is the “rule” or “authority” of love. Kenarchy is the “new politics” of love that Jesus introduces with a kingdom made up of servants who renounce power over others. ([Location 2183](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GOZRQ42&location=2183))
- As the Kenosis Hymn declares, King Jesus, whom Christians call the “Lord of all” (Acts 10:36), was isa Theo. Jesus was Caesar’s equal if not superior. And yet, the Hymn continues, Jesus did not consider this status as something to be harpagmon—a Greek word that’s a bit tricky to translate. Some translations render it “clung to” or “grasped.” But a longer and more literal translation is one from the NIV above: “did not consider it something to be used to his own advantage.” This definition of harpagmon is key in understanding kenosis, as kenosis is framed in the Hymn as the opposite of harpagmon. Harpagmon literally means to seize something as plunder with an open use of force. Harpagmon is a term with military overtones, a term of power and violence. Harpagmon is the Lucifer effect.

- I keep a Harrowing of Hell icon in my office to remind me of the power of the Devil at work in my life. My slavery to the fear of death must be cast out—exorcised—if perfect love is to reign in my life, a love that moves me from death to life. Spiritual warfare is battling against the power of the Devil. Which means that spiritual warfare is becoming emancipated from our slavery to the fear of death so that we can experience love and resurrection.

- Lots of people, it seems, don’t think about death at all, so bringing up death or the potential for loss seems unnecessarily morbid and depressing. It’s not that they don’t admit the possibility of death, just that they don’t feel particularly enslaved to the fear of death. And it’s hard to be convinced that you’re enslaved to something you don’t think or worry much about. ([Location 2326](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GOZRQ42&location=2326))
- People walk into Sunday-morning assemblies feeling tired and depleted. We’re running on fumes. Our tanks are empty. So when we hear words like “radical” we just don’t know how we’re going to find the time or energy to fit that into our busy, exhausted, overscheduled lives. It might not seem like exhaustion is a manifestation of our fear of death, but it is. Our worries about exhaustion are all about being physically and biologically worn down and depleted. And when physical resources are running low we grow worried and anxious. You have to if you want to survive. Basically, we encounter our fear of death whenever we run up against our limitations. Brené Brown calls this the “never enough” problem, a worry rooted in our concerns about scarcity. ([Location 2335](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GOZRQ42&location=2335))
- That assessment, scarcity is a culture where everyone is “hyperaware of lack,” is personally and politically potent. Politically because we know that America is a culture driven by fear.

- Fears rooted in a culture of scarcity undermine our ability to love each other. ([Location 2353](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GOZRQ42&location=2353))
- We all can relate to this reverie of lack. There’s the physical experience of lack: not enough sleep, time, or energy. Not enough money to pay the bills. But there’s also a lack that relates to our self-esteem: not enough success, influence, or recognition affects our feelings of worthiness and usefulness. We experience the never-enough problem in two different ways: not having enough and not being enough. And both sorts of scarcity create fears that undermine our ability to love. Scarcity becomes the power of the Devil in our lives. These two experiences of scarcity—not having enough and not being enough—affect our ability to love each other, fully, joyfully, and sacrificially. ([Location 2363](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GOZRQ42&location=2363))
- Thirsting as we do to take center stage and stand in the limelight, it’s hard to step out of the spotlight and serve in small and unnoticed ways.

- It’s the same problem we struggle with when it comes to marginalizing our privilege, power, or position as we focus on the voices and concerns of those who have been marginalized and oppressed. Even our social justice efforts become contaminated by our desire to be the center of attention as we fail to place weaker and less powerful voices at the center of our concerns.

- Compassion seems to pull us toward never-ending sacrifice. We perform the calculus of love in our hearts and the cost just seems to skyrocket, with no end in sight. And as the cost rises so does our anxiety. We fear that if we pay the price of love nothing will be left over. Love crashes into our fears about scarcity. One possible rebuttal is how this model of benevolence privileges the isolated individual as an agent of charity. Of course one person can’t save the entire world. We need to talk about social structures, systems, and sustainability. I agree that Christianity is best expressed in locally rooted and ecologically sustainable communities of mutual care and aid. But let’s not kid ourselves. These communities have their own high costs, demands that scare us and cause us to pull away. And in the meantime we’ll still get asked this week to help with an unpaid bill or be drawn into a friendship that is going to demand an extraordinary amount of time and energy. And most of the time, if I’m honest, I just don’t feel like I have it in me to help any more people. This fear of scarcity is what it looks like to be enslaved to the fear of death, a fear that is the power of the Devil as it undermines, at every turn, our ability and willingness to love each other. Thirsting for attention, we don’t want to wash feet. Crippled by shame, we pull away from others. Running on empty, we pull back from the needs of the world fearing that we’ll be exhausted and used up. We’re hobbled and incapacitated by fear. Which is why perfect love must cast out and exorcize fear. In order to love we must be set free from the power of the Devil. ([Location 2410](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GOZRQ42&location=2410))
- The charismatic spirituality I’ve encountered in those communities has taught me that worship and prayer are practices of gratitude and joy that combat my mindset of scarcity. The practices of worship and prayer place me in a receptive posture where I receive myself and everything in my life as grace and gift, and an experience of abundance displaces my reverie of lack. And as I experience gratitude, gift, grace, and abundance, the fears that have crippled my love are cast out and exorcised. I become set free from the power of death. In worship and prayer I am emancipated from the power of the Devil. I am being liberated by joy. ([Location 2430](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GOZRQ42&location=2430))
- Psychologists will tell you that gratitude is one of the strongest, if not the strongest, predictors of happiness. And why is that? Because to feel grateful is to experience life as a gift, as an experience of grace and joy. ([Location 2439](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GOZRQ42&location=2439))
- Gratitude is the experience that, in Christ, I have and am “enough.” When I practice gratitude I begin to operate out of a sense of abundance rather than scarcity, acting out of joy rather than fear. ([Location 2441](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GOZRQ42&location=2441))
- At the end of each day take a moment to count your blessings by writing them down in a journal. And you know what happened?

([Location 2453](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GOZRQ42&location=2453))
- But there is more to this than simple thankfulness. In the Bible thanksgiving is always rooted in doxology, an expression of praise and worship. And the point of worship isn’t to dance in the aisles as we do at Freedom. The point of worship is allegiance, the confrontation of our idolatry.

([Location 2468](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GOZRQ42&location=2468))

- when you read through the book of Acts, that collection of stories about the early followers of Jesus, whenever there’s an exorcism, a riot breaks out. And the riots are always about someone losing money. Casting out the Devil affects the marketplace. ([Location 2500](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GOZRQ42&location=2500))
- It’s difficult to disentangle the political and economic aspects of our battle with the principalities and powers from the underlying spiritual struggle. Both conservative and progressive Christians tend to miss how these are two sides of the same coin. Conservatives tend to focus exclusively upon the spiritual aspects of spiritual warfare. This “spiritualizes” the struggle, which drains it of any political or economic impact or import. Spiritual warfare in the hands of many conservative Christians reduces it to something spooky, fretting about disembodied spirits floating around in the air. Progressive Christians, by contrast, tend to ignore the spiritual aspects of the struggle, focusing exclusively upon the political and economic arena. Where conservatives spiritualize spiritual warfare, progressives politicize the struggle. So when it comes to the riots in Acts, both groups overlook the spirituality of political and economic systems, how these systems are supported and animated by values, morals, worldviews, and cultural norms, that economies are guided by a spirit—a Zeitgeist—an unseen and animating spiritual center. That’s the critical piece of the puzzle doubting and disenchanted Christians miss when they stop talking about the Devil and spiritual warfare. The animating spiritual center—the spiritual heart and soul of civic life in Philippi and Ephesus—is precisely what was being disrupted by the coming of the kingdom of God in the book of Acts. And since doubting and disenchanted Christians miss this, they miss what was and is so subversive and unsettling about the kingdom of God. Consequently, doubting and disenchanted Christians can’t locate the key to unlock one of the great paradoxes of the book of Acts—the secret to the kingdom’s revolutionary, riot-inducing power.

- The church was turning the world upside down. Throwing city after city into political and economic chaos. Holy hell breaking out. Despite a lack of overt antagonism, the Roman Empire came to see the Christian church as a threat, targeting Christians for persecution. Paul was beheaded. Christians were thrown to lions. Followers of Jesus were killed in gladiator games. This is the paradox of Jesus. Rome had trouble officially locating a treasonous element in Jesus and his followers, but riots broke out. The church was turning the world upside down. Something revolutionary was happening, but Rome had trouble seeing what it was. And I think we have the same problem. It’s hard for us to nail down exactly why the church was so subversive and revolutionary. What happened was that when people gave their spiritual allegiance to King Jesus, they started opting out of the Roman Zeitgeist and its political and economic systems.

- The church struck a blow at the foundations, and the whole world started to crumble. ([Location 2591](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GOZRQ42&location=2591))
- The revolutionary nature of the church was that it didn’t focus on specific locations of oppression. The church didn’t focus on chipping away at a Roman injustice here or a Roman injustice there. The church had a more radical approach—and I use that word intentionally. The word radical comes from the Latin word radix meaning “root.” The church was radical in that it was pulling up the roots of Roman society, calling into question the sacred foundations upon which imperial Rome was built. The church challenged the sacred and patriotic truths that justified Roman oppression and the belief that the empire was divinely ordained and, thus, beyond critique. Because, you know, god and country always go hand in hand. Once again, it’s the spiritual and the political, two sides of the same coin. Thus the revolutionary proclamation that Jesus of Nazareth was “Lord of all” (Acts 10:36), even over Caesar. And while Jesus did not consider his isa Theo “equal to god” status as something to be taken by force—choosing kenosis over harpagmon—the Lordship of Jesus did invalidate the spiritual legitimacy and authority of Caesar and imperial Rome. Ideologically speaking, Christianity made the empire subject to critique and dissent. Once Christ was confessed as Lord, blind obedience to empire was no longer automatic and assumed. Christianity had shrunk empire down to size. The emperor, the Christians pointed out, had no clothes. And standing naked and exposed before the eyes of their subjects, the empires of the world, then as now, lashed out. This is why the Romans coined a word to describe the early Christians. The Romans called the early Christians atheists—people who denied the gods of the empire, people who rejected the sacred foundations upon which their society had been built. And while the early church might have been nonviolent, this spiritual revolt and revolution made them dangerous.

- The ironic trouble with political activism is that it is often not radical enough. You might throw a brick through a window, but the principalities and powers can handle a bit of broken glass. And far too often political activism is co-opted by the very powers it is trying to change. Activism often involves fighting empire with the tools of empire, leaving empire fully intact once the marching and protests are over. The status quo remains sturdily in place. This isn’t to say that political activism or electoral politics are useless or ineffective. Some laws and policies are better than others. And some have lasting and revolutionary significance. So it’s our duty and responsibility to engage in this ongoing work. But this political work often fails to get to the spiritual roots of systemic injustice… ([Location 2607](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GOZRQ42&location=2607))
- At the heart of the biblical imagination, the sin at the core of all sin is the sin of idolatry, worshiping and giving ultimate allegiance to the god of your nation.… ([Location 2615](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GOZRQ42&location=2615))

- Every moment of every day we are surrounded by a multitude of institutions and organizations that compete for our service, loyalty, attention, allegiance, commitment, and worship. Maybe the nationstate is the Big Idol on the block, but we struggle with lesser idols on a constant and daily basis. The most obvious one is likely to be your place of work. Or any other institution you feel passionate about or committed to. And that includes your religious denomination… ([Location 2619](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GOZRQ42&location=2619))
- moment by moment I’m tempted in all sorts of ways to privilege service and allegiance to any of these powers over my allegiance to the kingdom of God. And what I mean by that is that my allegiance and investment in these powers makes it hard for me to love people. ([Location 2627](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GOZRQ42&location=2627))
- When we give our ultimate allegiance to any of the principalities and powers, large or small, we find ourselves perennially at war with anyone who places these things at risk. Idolatry breeds perpetual vigilance and violence. ([Location 2637](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GOZRQ42&location=2637))

- What puzzled Stringfellow as he interviewed members of the resistance is how the risks they took seemed to vastly outweigh any progress their small acts of defiance would accomplish. ([Location 2678](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GOZRQ42&location=2678))
- The answer that Stringfellow got was that in a world controlled by the Nazis, resistance was the only way to preserve and protect your humanity. The goal of resistance wasn’t simply to topple Hitler. Resistance had to be a way of life, the only way to live as an agent of grace and love in a dark and evil world. To not resist was to die, to undergo to a spiritual death, to surrender to the surrounding and enveloping darkness. ([Location 2690](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GOZRQ42&location=2690))
- In a world dominated by indifference, suffering, and violence, love is a heroic act of resistance. ([Location 2701](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GOZRQ42&location=2701))

- For many Christians, emulating the love of Jesus becomes what erodes faith in Jesus. ([Location 2715](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GOZRQ42&location=2715))
- for the White Rose the Holocaust wasn’t a theological problem to be solved. For the White Rose the Holocaust was a reality to be resisted. ([Location 2719](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GOZRQ42&location=2719))
- Our response to suffering isn’t intellectual but behavioral. ([Location 2721](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GOZRQ42&location=2721))
- Resistance is our only theodicy. ([Location 2722](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GOZRQ42&location=2722))
- And in the hands of the New Testament writers, especially the apostle Paul, the Great Apocalypse in the history of the world isn’t about the destruction of the world at the end of time. The Great Apocalypse is the apocalypse of Jesus Christ, God breaking into, invading, and disrupting the settled order of the world by establishing the kingdom of God on earth through the Lordship of Jesus. ([Location 2727](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GOZRQ42&location=2727))
- This invasion is the War of the Lamb. The apocalyptic kingdom is an invasion of love. ([Location 2738](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GOZRQ42&location=2738))
- Strategies are techniques used by the powerful. These are the techniques of top-down power and lording over others. Invade, defeat, dominate, expand. Rinse and repeat. Strategies are the techniques of empire. Strategies are the techniques of harpagmon and the Lucifer effect. Strategies are what Satan offered to Jesus on the mountain. The powerful rule the world, Jesus said, by lording over and exercising authority over others. Tactics, by contrast, are the techniques of the weak. Lacking power and therefore unable to dominate, control, or force things, the weak must resort to the techniques of subversion, sabotage, and guerilla warfare. If strategies are exercises in top-down power, tactics emerge from the bottom up. Further, the weak are always operating in enemy territory. Consequently, the weak have to be opportunistic and experts of improvisation. ([Location 2748](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GOZRQ42&location=2748))

- because love appears to us as weakness in the world, love always operates tactically, subversively, and opportunistically. ([Location 2760](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GOZRQ42&location=2760))
- In Jesus the kingdom of God has apocalyptically invaded the world, and as this is an invasion of love it’s a tactical engagement. Love is guerilla warfare. A great campaign of sabotage. ([Location 2770](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GOZRQ42&location=2770))

- When politically focused, interrupting the world with love will often look like “angelic troublemaking,” ([Location 2782](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GOZRQ42&location=2782))
- one of the most important ways we can interrupt the world with love is by simply speaking up and telling the truth. ([Location 2798](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GOZRQ42&location=2798))
- More often than not, spiritual warfare is simply telling the truth, especially speaking “truth to power” in the face of the Orwellian propaganda being spread by the principalities and powers. ([Location 2801](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GOZRQ42&location=2801))

- Dispelling the ideological illusions being spun by the principalities and powers is often the first step in tactical interruption. ([Location 2804](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GOZRQ42&location=2804))
- when we remain silent in the face of injustice and oppression we give aid and support to oppressive and unjust power structures, because our quiet acceptance of the status quo reinforces the status quo as both normal and right. Our silence—our refusal to interrupt our neighbors with truth—is taken as tacit approval of how the powers are running the world. That collective silence creates the illusion of universal agreement and approval, which stifles dissent and protest by making them seem abnormal and crazy. ([Location 2808](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GOZRQ42&location=2808))
- Lovingly interrupting the world with truth means dispelling the illusion of universal approval and agreement so that dissent and protest can appear sane, reasonable, and legitimate. Simply speaking up makes a difference. Speaking up cracks the illusion of universal agreement, making dissent and protest possible. A new way of life becomes imaginable. Speaking up is angelic troublemaking, lovingly interrupting the world with truth. ([Location 2812](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GOZRQ42&location=2812))
- Beyond interrupting the world through resistance and solidarity, we can also interrupt the world with acts of inclusion and kindness. If Jesus had a favorite tactic it was his practice of table fellowship, breaking bread with the outcasts of society. ([Location 2836](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GOZRQ42&location=2836))
- Spiritual warfare is putting love where there is no love. It is the action of grace in territory controlled by the devil, being true to love in a world that is cold and lonely and mean. It is the kingdom of God breaking into and interrupting our lives. ([Location 2862](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GOZRQ42&location=2862))
