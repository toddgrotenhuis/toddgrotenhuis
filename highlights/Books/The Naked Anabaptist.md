## Highlights
- the kingdom of God we are called to is radically different from all versions of the kingdoms of the world. ([Location 36](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003EOAD4C&location=36))
- kingdoms of the world all manifest the character of Caesar as they seek to rule people and conquer enemies with the power of the sword, the kingdom of God always manifests the character of Jesus, seeking to serve people and love enemies as it manifests the power of the cross. ([Location 37](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003EOAD4C&location=37))

    - Note: Had you thought of this distinction, before? (Caesar/rule/sword vs. Jesus/serve/cross)
- we are called to live in community with others, to live simply, humbly, and justly, and to share our lives and our resources with one another and with all who are in need. ([Location 41](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003EOAD4C&location=41))
- the vision of the kingdom these tribes are espousing was the general understanding of the church for the first three centuries of its existence. ([Location 44](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003EOAD4C&location=44))
- salvation was not primarily about getting people to heaven when they die but was about God's transforming power affecting every area of life, society, and creation. ([Location 52](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003EOAD4C&location=52))
- "I'm so relieved to find others who believe what I do. People in my church think I'm crazy when I go on about these things." ([Location 129](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003EOAD4C&location=129))
- those who discovered Anabaptism experienced this encounter, as I did, as a homecoming. ([Location 135](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003EOAD4C&location=135))
- Writers from many traditions have spoken warmly of Anabaptism, some suggesting it might be a movement whose time has come and a way of being Christian that makes sense in post-Christendom culture. This strange ecumenism is worrying to some, but deeply attractive to others. ([Location 141](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003EOAD4C&location=141))
    - Note: Why do you think this is?
- I had a conversation at a recent event with an anarchist who was fascinated by the Anabaptist tradition. ([Location 144](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003EOAD4C&location=144))

    - Note: There's a large, growing tradition of Anabaptist anarchists.
- "What would happen if Christians devoted the same discipline and self-sacrifice to nonviolent peacemaking that armies devote to war?" ([Location 168](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003EOAD4C&location=168))
- early Baptist leaders were deeply influenced by Dutch Anabaptists. ([Location 186](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003EOAD4C&location=186))
- "Emergent represents a rediscovery of the Anabaptist spirit. It's very hard in other Protestant denominations to find people who take Jesus as teacher deeply seriously, and take Jesus' teachings and the Sermon on the Mount, and Jesus' ([Location 195](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003EOAD4C&location=195))
- the ungrounded world of charismatic spirituality; the intense intellectual world of theology; ([Location 212](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003EOAD4C&location=212))
- I felt instinctively that Christians should not be ruling society but should be a witness to it, an alternative society with different values. ([Location 218](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003EOAD4C&location=218))

- It was great to find a group of people who thought similar things to me and to be able to think more deeply about these things. ([Location 227](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003EOAD4C&location=227))
- competing for hearts and minds and, at least as importantly, for the support of various political authorities. ([Location 247](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003EOAD4C&location=247))
    - Note: Could this be why Anabaptism wasn't _big_ under Christendom?
- What few historians did was to investigate what Anabaptists wrote or said about themselves or how most Anabaptists actually lived. ([Location 261](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003EOAD4C&location=261))
- One of the obstacles we face as we investigate this tradition is that Anabaptism is sometimes presented in a rather academic way. ([Location 269](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003EOAD4C&location=269))
    - Note: Agreed. Do you? How do we counter this, or should we?
- There was a central core of belief and behavior that distinguished them from others and welded them together into a movement, but Anabaptism was never uniform. ([Location 278](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003EOAD4C&location=278))
- There are advantages to this policy, but we recognize that it also has certain drawbacks-not least that the Anabaptist tradition can be presented in an idealistic or disembodied way that is not tested in the rough-and-tumble of church life ([Location 290](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003EOAD4C&location=290))
- And the Celtic tradition has been mediated through poetry, art, music, and liturgy, rather than academic presentations, making it more accessible than the Anabaptist tradition. ([Location 296](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003EOAD4C&location=296))
    - Note: Is this related to my concern about worship and intellectualization?
      A: yes, he covers this in his later book about disenchantment.
- rebaptizing them years later implied that they-and the society into which they had been inducted-were not truly Christian. ([Location 304](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003EOAD4C&location=304))
- discipleship was not a higher calling for monks and nuns but expected of all believers. ([Location 311](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003EOAD4C&location=311))

- Some have suggested that in post-Christendom, baptizing one's child is as much an act of spiritual defiance as refusing to baptize one's child was in the sixteenth century. ([Location 316](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003EOAD4C&location=316))
- The Old and New Testaments both call for the people of God to be distinctive, nonconformist, and separate. ([Location 347](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003EOAD4C&location=347))
- Unlike their Catholic and Protestant contemporaries, Anabaptists never (with the exception of the Munster aberration) persecuted those with whom they disagreed or attempted to coerce conversion. ([Location 353](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003EOAD4C&location=353))

- 3. Western culture is slowly emerging from the Christendom era, when church and state jointly presided over a society in which almost all were assumed to be Christian. Whatever its positive contributions on values and institutions, Christendom seriously distorted the gospel, marginalized Jesus, and has left the churches ill equipped for mission in a post-Christendom culture.
