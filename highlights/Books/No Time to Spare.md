## Highlights
- Encouragement by denial, however well-meaning, backfires. ([Location 242](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MXXZYJ4&location=242))
- This is morally problematic when personal decision is confused with personal opinion. ([Location 256](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MXXZYJ4&location=256))
- Respect has often been overenforced and almost universally misplaced (the poor must respect the rich, all women must respect all men, etc.). But when applied in moderation and with judgment, the social requirement of respectful behavior to others, by repressing aggression and requiring self-control, makes room for understanding. It creates a space where appreciation and affection can grow. ([Location 262](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MXXZYJ4&location=262))
- it is so hard to be honest when you generalize. ([Location 526](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MXXZYJ4&location=526))

- Evidently this is the only story the child knows. It’s scary to see a mind trapped in an endless repetition of violent acts without meaning or resolution, only escalation to keep the stimulus going. ([Location 559](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MXXZYJ4&location=559))
- In any case, war is something human beings do and show no signs of stopping doing, and so it may be less important to condemn it or to justify it than to be able to perceive it as tragic. But once you take sides, you have lost that ability. ([Location 654](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MXXZYJ4&location=654))
- Might does not make right—right? Therefore right does not make might. Right? ... If we insist that in the real world the ultimate victor must be the good guy, we’ve sacrificed right to might. ([Location 667](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MXXZYJ4&location=667))
- Since we have worked so hard to separate History from Fiction, our fantasies are dire warnings, or mere nightmares, or else they are wish fulfillments. ([Location 682](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MXXZYJ4&location=682))
- What relates my small refusal to Sartre’s big one is the sense that to accept an award from an institution is to be co-opted by, embodied as, the institution. Sartre refused this on general principle, while I acted in specific protest. ([Location 738](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MXXZYJ4&location=738))
- “It doesn’t have to be the way it is” is a playful statement, made in the context of fiction, with no claim to “being real.” Yet it is a subversive statement. Subversion doesn’t suit people who, feeling their adjustment to life has been successful, want things to go on just as they are, or people who need support from authority assuring them that things are as they have to be. Fantasy not only asks “What if things didn’t go on just as they do?” but demonstrates what they might be like if they went otherwise—thus gnawing at the very foundation of the belief that things have to be the way they are.

- As for the charge of escapism, what does escape mean? Escape from real life, responsibility, order, duty, piety, is what the charge implies. But nobody, except the most criminally irresponsible or pitifully incompetent, escapes to jail. The direction of escape is toward freedom. So what is “escapism” an accusation of? ([Location 974](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MXXZYJ4&location=974))
- There really is nothing to fear in fantasy unless you are afraid of the freedom of uncertainty. This is why it’s hard for me to imagine that anyone who likes science can dislike fantasy. Both are based so profoundly on the admission of uncertainty, the welcoming acceptance of unanswered questions. ([Location 990](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MXXZYJ4&location=990))
- Both utopia and dystopia are often an enclave of maximum control surrounded by a wilderness—as ([Location 1010](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MXXZYJ4&location=1010))
- Yang, the dominator, always seeks to deny its dependence on yin. Huxley and Orwell uncompromisingly present the outcome of successful denial. ([Location 1020](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MXXZYJ4&location=1020))
- At present we seem only to write dystopias. Perhaps in order to be able to write a utopia we need to think yinly. I tried to write one in Always Coming Home. Did I succeed? Is a yin utopia a contradiction in terms, since all the familiar utopias rely on control to make them work, and yin does not control? Yet it is a great power. How does it work? I can only guess. My guess is that the kind of thinking we are, at last, beginning to do about how to change the goals of human domination and unlimited growth to those of human adaptability and long-term survival is a shift from yang to yin, and so involves acceptance of impermanence and imperfection, a patience with uncertainty and the makeshift, a friendship with water, darkness, and the earth.

### A Band of Brothers, a Stream of Sisters
- The power of male group solidarity must come from the control and channeling of male rivalry, the repression and concentration of the hormone-driven will to dominate that so often dominates men themselves. It is a remarkable reversal. ([Location 1122](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MXXZYJ4&location=1122))
- Male solidarity appears to me to have been the prime shaper of most of the great ancient institutions of society—Government, Army, Priesthood, University, and the new one that may be devouring all the others, Corporation. ([Location 1128](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MXXZYJ4&location=1128))
- Wherever the male arrangement of society permits the fellowship of women on their own terms, it tends to be casual, unformulated, unhierarchical; to be ad hoc rather than fixed, flexible rather than rigid, and more collaborative than competitive. ([Location 1134](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MXXZYJ4&location=1134))
- Instead of rising from the rigorous control of aggression in the pursuit of power, the energy of female solidarity comes from the wish and need for mutual aid and, often, the search for freedom from oppression. Elusiveness is the essence of fluidity. ([Location 1138](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MXXZYJ4&location=1138))
- Misogyny is by no means limited to men. Living in “a man’s world,” plenty of women distrust and fear themselves as much or more than men do. ([Location 1143](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MXXZYJ4&location=1143))
- The nature of sisterhood is so utterly different from the power of brotherhood that it’s hard to predict how it might change society. ([Location 1147](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MXXZYJ4&location=1147))
- The great ancient male institutions have been increasingly infiltrated by women for the last two centuries, and this is a very great change. But when women manage to join the institutions that excluded them, they mostly end up being co-opted by them, serving male ends, enforcing male values. ([Location 1149](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MXXZYJ4&location=1149))

- I think feminism continues and will continue to exist wherever women work in their own way with one another and with men, and wherever women and men go on questioning male definitions of value, refusing gender exclusivity, affirming interdependence, distrusting aggression, seeking freedom always. ([Location 1161](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MXXZYJ4&location=1161))
- now that most war is waged not between armies but by machines killing civilians, what’s the meaning of a military uniform at all? ([Location 1209](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MXXZYJ4&location=1209))
- Didn’t the child dead in the ruins of a bombed village die for her country just as any soldier does? ([Location 1210](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MXXZYJ4&location=1210))

### Clinging Desperately to a Metaphor
- IT’S AS SILLY for me to write about economics as it would be for most economists to write about the use of enjambment in iambic pentameter. But they don’t live in a library, and I do live in an economy. Their life can be perfectly poetry-free if they like, but my life is controlled by their stuff whether I like it or not. ([Location 1225](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MXXZYJ4&location=1225))
- In taking uncontrolled, unlimited, unceasing growth as the only recipe for economic health, we’ve dismissed the ideas of optimum size and keeping the organism in balance. ([Location 1234](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MXXZYJ4&location=1234))
- The competitive techniques of plants and animals are endless in variety and ingenuity. So why are we, clever we, stuck on one and one only? ([Location 1248](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MXXZYJ4&location=1248))
- At this rate, by the time we admit that cancer is not health, that we’re sick, any cure must be so radical as almost certainly to require dictatorial rule, and to destroy more—physically and morally—than it can save. ([Location 1263](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MXXZYJ4&location=1263))
- I have watched my country accept, mostly quite complacently, along with a lower living standard for more and more people, a lower moral standard. ([Location 1300](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MXXZYJ4&location=1300))
- Is the red-blooded freedom-loving American so infantile that he has to be promised whatever he wants right now this moment? ([Location 1321](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MXXZYJ4&location=1321))

### The Inner Child and the Nude Politician
- Indifference to what words actually say; willingness to accept a vapid truism as a useful, even revelatory concept; carelessness about where a supposed quotation comes from—that’s all part of what I like least about the Internet. A “blah blah blah, who cares, information is what I want it to be” attitude—a lazy-mindedness that degrades both language and thought. ([Location 1349](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MXXZYJ4&location=1349))
- Nature, says Wordsworth, offers us endless reminders of the eternal, and we are most open to them in our childhood. ([Location 1386](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MXXZYJ4&location=1386))
- the innocence, the unjudging, unqualified openness to experience of the young child, can be seen as a spiritual quality attainable or reattainable by the adult. ([Location 1395](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MXXZYJ4&location=1395))
- I see children as unfinished beings who have been given a very large job to do. ([Location 1414](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MXXZYJ4&location=1414))
- Children are by nature, by necessity, irresponsible, and irresponsibility in them, as in puppies or kittens, is part of their charm. Carried into adulthood it becomes a dire practical and ethical failing. ([Location 1419](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MXXZYJ4&location=1419))
- “become as little children” is a spiritual counsel, not an intellectual, practical, or ethical one. ([Location 1421](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MXXZYJ4&location=1421))
- Innocence is wisdom only of the spirit. ([Location 1421](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MXXZYJ4&location=1421))
- In order to see that our emperors have no clothes on, do we really have to wait for a child to say so? Or even worse, wait for somebody’s Inner Brat to pipe up? If so, we’re in for a lot of nude politicians. ([Location 1422](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MXXZYJ4&location=1422))
    - Note: Narrator voice: we are
- Ogans, ingesting only the unsullied purity of the O in the atmosphere and in H2O, will live in true amity with all animals and all vegetables, and will proudly preach their creed for as long as they possibly can. It could be for several weeks, sometimes. ([Location 1456](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MXXZYJ4&location=1456))
### Belief in Belief
- The whole undertaking of science is to deal, as well as it can, with reality. The reality of actual things and events in time is subject to doubt, to hypothesis, to proof and disproof, to acceptance and rejection—not to belief or disbelief. ([Location 1482](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MXXZYJ4&location=1482))
- I see no opposition between accepting the theory of evolution and believing in God. ([Location 1485](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MXXZYJ4&location=1485))
### About Anger
#### i. Saeva indignatio
- Anger points powerfully to the denial of rights, but the exercise of rights can’t live and thrive on anger. It lives and thrives on the dogged pursuit of justice. ([Location 1545](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MXXZYJ4&location=1545))

- The racism, misogyny, and counter-rationality of the reactionary right in American politics for the last several years is a frightening exhibition of the destructive force of anger deliberately nourished by hate, encouraged to rule thought, invited to control behavior. I hope our republic survives this orgy of self-indulgent rage. ([Location 1551](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MXXZYJ4&location=1551))

#### ii. Private Anger
- Certainly an outburst of anger can cleanse the soul and clear the air. But anger nursed and nourished begins to act like anger suppressed: it begins to poison the air with vengefulness, spitefulness, distrust, breeding grudge and resentment, brooding endlessly over the causes of the grudge, the righteousness of the resentment. ([Location 1559](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MXXZYJ4&location=1559))
- anger is a good weapon. But a weapon is appropriate to, justified only by, a situation of danger. ([Location 1562](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MXXZYJ4&location=1562))
- Perhaps the problem is this: when threatened, we pull out our weapon, anger. Then the threat passes or evaporates. But the weapon is still in our hand. And weapons are seductive, even addictive; they promise to give us strength, security, dominance . . . ([Location 1564](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MXXZYJ4&location=1564))
- If I’m in an angry mood and aware of it, I can ask myself, So what is it you’re afraid of? ([Location 1572](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MXXZYJ4&location=1572))
- My fears come down to fear of not being safe (as if anyone is ever safe) and of not being in control (as if I ever was in control). Does the fear of being unsafe and not in control express itself as anger, or does it use anger as a kind of denial of the fear? ([Location 1587](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MXXZYJ4&location=1587))
- Maybe the prolonged “festival of cruelty” going on in our literature and movies is an attempt to get rid of repressed anger by expressing it, acting it out symbolically. ([Location 1605](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MXXZYJ4&location=1605))
- Anger that targets everything and everybody indiscriminately is the futile, infantile, psychotic rage of the man with an automatic rifle shooting preschoolers. ([Location 1609](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MXXZYJ4&location=1609))
- A cat with a mouse—the cliché example of cruelty. I want to say clearly that I do not believe any animal is capable of being cruel. Cruelty implies consciousness of another’s pain and the intent to cause it. Cruelty is a human specialty, which human beings continue to practice, and perfect, and institutionalize, though we seldom boast about it. We prefer to disown it, calling it “inhumanity,” ascribing it to animals. We don’t want to admit the innocence of the animals, which reveals our guilt. ([Location 1648](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MXXZYJ4&location=1648))

- Maybe we have at last worked through the period when serious music had to seek antiharmony and strive to shock the ear. ([Location 1739](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MXXZYJ4&location=1739))
- envy self-confidence even as I dislike it. Envy coexists only too easily with righteous disapproval. Indeed perhaps the two nasty creatures live off each other. ([Location 1779](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MXXZYJ4&location=1779))
- Democracy, by strenuously denying the fact of inequality, does enable us, to a surprising extent, to act as if it didn’t exist; but it does exist, and we know it. So our job is to keep the inequity of power as small as possible, and refuse to let our common humanity be reduced, however slightly, even by a careless word, by an assertion of unequal worth.
