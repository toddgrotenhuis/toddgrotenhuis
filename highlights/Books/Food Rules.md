## Highlights
- FACT 1. Populations that eat a so-called Western diet—generally defined as a diet consisting of lots of processed foods and meat, lots of added fat and sugar, lots of refined grains, lots of everything except vegetables, fruits, and whole grains—invariably suffer from high rates of the so-called Western diseases: obesity, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer. ([Location 127](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002YJK5L4&location=127))
- The arguments in nutritional science are not about this well-established link; rather, they are all about identifying the culprit nutrient in the Western diet that might be responsible for chronic diseases. Is it the saturated fat or the refined carbohydrates or the lack of fiber or the transfats or omega-6 fatty acids—or what? The point is that, as eaters (if not as scientists), we know all we need to know to act: This diet, for whatever reason, is the problem. ([Location 132](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002YJK5L4&location=132))
- FACT 2. Populations eating a remarkably wide range of traditional diets generally don’t suffer from these chronic diseases. ([Location 135](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002YJK5L4&location=135))
- What this suggests is that there is no single ideal human diet but that the human omnivore is exquisitely adapted to a wide range of different foods and a variety of different diets. Except, that is, for one: the relatively new (in evolutionary terms) Western diet that most of us now are eating. ([Location 139](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002YJK5L4&location=139))
- In one analysis, a typical American population that departed even modestly from the Western diet (and lifestyle) could reduce its chances of getting coronary heart disease by 80 percent, its chances of type 2 diabetes by 90 percent, and its chances of colon cancer by 70 percent.2 ([Location 146](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002YJK5L4&location=146))
- The healthcare industry makes more money treating chronic diseases (which account for three quarters of the $2 trillion plus we spend each year on health care in this country) than preventing them. ([Location 152](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002YJK5L4&location=152))
- The more you process any food, the more profitable it becomes. ([Location 152](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002YJK5L4&location=152))
- But for the Nutritional Industrial Complex this uncertainty is not necessarily a problem, because confusion too is good business: The nutrition experts become indispensable; the food manufacturers can reengineer their products (and health claims) to reflect the latest findings, and those of us in the media who follow these issues have a constant stream of new food and health stories to report. Everyone wins. Except, that is, for us eaters. ([Location 154](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002YJK5L4&location=154))
- Eat food. Not too much. Mostly plants. ([Location 162](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002YJK5L4&location=162))
- Not only can processing remove nutrients and add toxic chemicals, but it makes food more readily absorbable, which can be a problem for our insulin and fat metabolism. ([Location 189](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002YJK5L4&location=189))
- While I call them rules, I think of them less as hard-and-fast laws than as personal policies. Policies are useful tools. Instead of prescribing highly specific behaviors, they supply us with broad guidelines that should make everyday decision making easier and swifter. ([Location 208](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002YJK5L4&location=208))
- But do be sure to adopt at least one from each of the three sections, because each section deals with a different dimension of your eating life. ([Location 213](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002YJK5L4&location=213))
### PART I What should I eat?
#### 1 Eat food.
#### 2 Don’t eat anything your great-grandmother wouldn’t recognize as food.
- Today foods are processed in ways specifically designed to get us to buy and eat more by pushing our evolutionary buttons—our inborn preferences for sweetness and fat and salt. These tastes are difficult to find in nature but cheap and easy for the food scientist to deploy, with the result that food processing induces us to consume much more of these rarities than is good for us. ([Location 239](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002YJK5L4&location=239))
#### 3 Avoid food products containing ingredients that no ordinary human would keep in the pantry.
#### 4 Avoid food products that contain high-fructose corn syrup.
#### 5 Avoid foods that have some form of sugar (or sweetener) listed among the top three ingredients.
- thanks to food science, there are now some forty types of sugar used in processed food, including barley malt, beet sugar, brown rice syrup, cane juice, corn sweetener, dextrin, dextrose, fructo-oligosaccharides, fruit juice concentrate, glucose, sucrose, invert sugar, polydextrose, sucrose, turbinado sugar, and so on. To repeat: Sugar is sugar. ([Location 263](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002YJK5L4&location=263))
- As for noncaloric sweeteners such as aspartame or Splenda, research (in both humans and animals) suggests that switching to artificial sweeteners does not lead to weight loss, for reasons not yet well understood. But it may be that deceiving the brain with the reward of sweetness stimulates a craving for even more sweetness. ([Location 266](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002YJK5L4&location=266))
#### 6 Avoid food products that contain more than five ingredients.
#### 7 Avoid food products containing ingredients that a third-grader cannot pronounce.
#### 8 Avoid food products that make health claims.
- only the big food manufacturers have the where-withal to secure FDA-approved health claims for their products and then trumpet them to the world. ([Location 282](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002YJK5L4&location=282))
#### 9 Avoid food products with the wordoid “lite” or the terms “low-fat” or “nonfat” in their names.
#### 10 Avoid foods that are pretending to be something they are not.
- The same rule applies to soy-based mock meats, artificial sweeteners, and fake fats and starches. ([Location 302](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002YJK5L4&location=302))
#### 11 Avoid foods you see advertised on television.
- Only the biggest food manufacturers can afford to advertise their products on television: More than two thirds of food advertising is spent promoting processed foods (and alcohol), so if you avoid products with big ad budgets, you’ll automatically be avoiding edible foodlike substances. ([Location 308](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002YJK5L4&location=308))
#### 12 Shop the peripheries of the supermarket and stay out of the middle.
#### 13 Eat only foods that will eventually rot.
#### 14 Eat foods made from ingredients that you can picture in their raw state or growing in nature.
#### 15 Get out of the supermarket whenever you can.
#### 16 Buy your snacks at the farmers’ market.
#### 17 Eat only foods that have been cooked by humans.
#### 18 Don’t ingest foods made in places where everyone is required to wear a surgical cap.
#### 19 If it came from a plant, eat it; if it was made in a plant, don’t.
#### 20 It’s not food if it arrived through the window of your car.
#### 21 It’s not food if it’s called by the same name in every language. (Think Big Mac, Cheetos, or Pringles.)
### PART II What kind of food should I eat?
#### 22 Eat mostly plants, especially leaves.
- There are scores of studies demonstrating that a diet rich in vegetables and fruits reduces the risk of dying from all the Western diseases; ([Location 374](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002YJK5L4&location=374))
#### 23 Treat meat as a flavoring or special occasion food.
- people who eat meat a couple of times a week—are just as healthy as vegetarians. ([Location 385](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002YJK5L4&location=385))
#### 24 “Eating what stands on one leg [mushrooms and plant foods] is better than eating what stands on two legs [fowl], which is better than eating what stands on four legs [cows, pigs, and other mammals].”
#### 25 Eat your colors.
#### 26 Drink the spinach water.
- The water in which vegetables are cooked is rich in vitamins and other healthful plant chemicals. Save it for soup or add it to sauces. ([Location 404](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002YJK5L4&location=404))
#### 27 Eat animals that have themselves eaten well.
- food animals that can tolerate grain are much healthier when they have access to green plants—and so, it turns out, are their meat and eggs. ([Location 411](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002YJK5L4&location=411))
#### 28 If you have the space, buy a freezer.
- When you find a good source of pastured meat, you’ll want to buy it in quantity. Buying meat in bulk—a quarter of a steer, say, or a whole hog—is one way to eat well on a budget. ([Location 417](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002YJK5L4&location=417))
#### 29 Eat like an omnivore.
- it’s a good idea to try to add some new species, and not just new foods, to your diet—that is, new kinds of plants, animals, and fungi. ([Location 424](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002YJK5L4&location=424))
- The dazzling diversity of food products on offer in the supermarket is deceptive, because so many of them are made from the same small handful of plant species, and most of those—the corn and soy and wheat—are seeds rather than leaves. ([Location 425](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002YJK5L4&location=425))
#### 30 Eat well-grown food from healthy soil.
- soils rich in organic matter produce more nutritious food: that is, food with higher levels of antioxidants, flavonoids, vitamins, and minerals. ([Location 436](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002YJK5L4&location=436))
- Of course, after a few days riding cross-country in a truck, the nutritional quality of any kind of produce will deteriorate, so ideally you want to eat food that is both organic and local. ([Location 437](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002YJK5L4&location=437))
#### 31 Eat wild foods when you can.
- Two of the most nutritious plants in the world —lamb’s quarters and purslane—are weeds, and some of the healthiest traditional diets, like the Mediterranean, make frequent use of wild greens. ([Location 440](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002YJK5L4&location=440))
- We also breed for shelf life, and so have unwittingly selected for plants with low levels of omega-3 fatty acids, since these fats quickly oxidize—turn rancid. ([Location 444](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002YJK5L4&location=444))
#### 32 Don’t overlook the oily little fishes.
- Avoid big fish at the top of the marine food chain—tuna, swordfish, shark—because they’re endangered, and because they often contain high levels of mercury. ([Location 451](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002YJK5L4&location=451))
- According to a Dutch proverb, “A land with lots of herring can get along with few doctors.” ([Location 453](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002YJK5L4&location=453))
#### 33 Eat some foods that have been predigested by bacteria or fungi.
- These foods can be a good source of vitamin B12, an essential nutrient you can’t get from plants. (B12 is produced by animals and bacteria.) ([Location 458](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002YJK5L4&location=458))
- Many fermented foods also contain probiotics—beneficial bacteria that research suggests improve the function of the digestive and immune systems and, according to some studies, help reduce allergic reactions and inflammation. ([Location 459](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002YJK5L4&location=459))
#### 34 Sweeten and salt your food yourself.
#### 35 Eat sweet foods as you find them in nature.
- In nature, sugars almost always come packaged with fiber, which slows their absorption and gives you a sense of satiety before you’ve ingested too many calories. That’s why you’re always better off eating the fruit rather than drinking its juice. ([Location 469](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002YJK5L4&location=469))
- (In general, calories taken in liquid form are more fattening because they don’t make us feel full. ([Location 471](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002YJK5L4&location=471))
- So don’t drink your sweets, ([Location 472](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002YJK5L4&location=472))
#### 36 Don’t eat breakfast cereals that change the color of the milk.
#### 37 “The whiter the bread, the sooner you’ll be dead.”
- As far as the body is concerned, white flour is not much different from sugar. Unless supplemented, it offers none of the good things (fiber, B vitamins, healthy fats) in whole grains—it’s little more than a shot of glucose. Large spikes of glucose are inflammatory and wreak havoc on our insulin metabolism. ([Location 481](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002YJK5L4&location=481))
    - Tags: [[favorite]] 
#### 38 Favor the kinds of oils and grains that have traditionally been stone-ground.
- When grindstones were the only way to refine flour and oil, flour and oil were generally more nutritious. ([Location 487](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002YJK5L4&location=487))
- The nutritional benefits of whole grains are impressive: fiber; the full range of B vitamins; and healthy oils, all of which are sacrificed when the grain is refined on modern roller mills (as mentioned, highly refined flours are little different from sugar). ([Location 489](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002YJK5L4&location=489))
- newer oils that are extracted by modern chemical means tend to have less favorable fatty acid profiles and more additives than olive, sesame, palm fruit, and peanut oils that have been obtained the old-fashioned way. ([Location 491](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002YJK5L4&location=491))
#### 39 Eat all the junk food you want as long as you cook it yourself.
- food manufacturers have made eating these formerly expensive and hard-to-make treats so cheap and easy that we’re eating them every day. ([Location 496](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002YJK5L4&location=496))
- If you made all the french fries you ate, you would eat them much less often, if only because they’re so much work. The same holds true for fried chicken, chips, cakes, pies, and ice cream. Enjoy these treats as often as you’re willing to prepare them—chances are good it won’t be every day. ([Location 498](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002YJK5L4&location=498))
#### 40 Be the kind of person who takes supplements—then skip the supplements.
- We know that people who take supplements are generally healthier than the rest of us, and we also know that in controlled studies most of the supplements they take don’t appear to be effective. ([Location 503](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002YJK5L4&location=503))
- As we age, our need for antioxidants increases while our body’s ability to absorb them from the diet declines. ([Location 507](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002YJK5L4&location=507))
#### 41 Eat more like the French. Or the Japanese. Or the Italians. Or the Greeks.
- In Latin America, corn is traditionally cooked with lime and eaten with beans; what would otherwise be a nutritionally deficient staple becomes the basis of a healthy, balanced diet. ([Location 518](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002YJK5L4&location=518))
- Traditional diets are more than the sum of their food parts. ([Location 520](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002YJK5L4&location=520))
#### 42 Regard nontraditional foods with skepticism.
- If diets are the products of an evolutionary process in which groups of people adapt to the plants, animals, and fungi a particular place has to offer, then a novel food or culinary innovation resembles a mutation: It might represent an evolutionary improvement, but chances are it doesn’t. ([Location 524](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002YJK5L4&location=524))
- Until we have that data, you’re probably better off eating soy prepared in the traditional Asian manner than according to the novel recipes dreamed up by food scientists. ([Location 530](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002YJK5L4&location=530))
#### 43 Have a glass of wine with dinner.
- Mindful of the social and health effects of alcoholism, public health authorities are loath to recommend drinking, but the fact is that people who drink moderately and regularly live longer and suffer considerably less heart disease than teetotalers. ([Location 535](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002YJK5L4&location=535))
- Alcohol of any kind appears to reduce the risk of heart disease, but the polyphenols in red wine (resveratrol in particular) may have unique protective qualities. ([Location 536](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002YJK5L4&location=536))
- Drinking a little every day is better than drinking a lot on the weekends, and drinking with food is better than drinking without it. ([Location 539](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002YJK5L4&location=539))
### PART III How should I eat?
- How you eat may have as much bearing on your health (and your weight) as what you eat. ([Location 546](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002YJK5L4&location=546))
#### 44 Pay more, eat less.
- The American food system has for many years devoted its energies to increasing quantity and reducing price rather than to improving quality. ([Location 558](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002YJK5L4&location=558))
- If you spend more for better food, you’ll probably eat less of it, and treat it with more care. ([Location 563](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002YJK5L4&location=563))
- “Better to pay the grocer than the doctor.” ([Location 564](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002YJK5L4&location=564))
    - Tags: [[favorite]] 
- Choose quality over quantity, food experience over mere calories. ([Location 564](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002YJK5L4&location=564))
#### 45 . . . Eat less.
#### 46 Stop eating before you’re full.
- So: Ask yourself not, Am I full? but, Is my hunger gone? ([Location 583](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002YJK5L4&location=583))
#### 47 Eat when you are hungry, not when you are bored.
- Food is a costly antidepressant. ([Location 588](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002YJK5L4&location=588))
    - Tags: [[favorite]] 
#### 48 Consult your gut.
- Most of us allow external, and usually visual, cues to determine how much we eat. The larger the portion, for example, the more we eat; the bigger the container, the more we pour. As in so many areas of modern life, the culture of food has become a culture of the eye. ([Location 591](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002YJK5L4&location=591))
- It can take twenty minutes before your brain gets the word that your belly is full; that means that if you take less than twenty minutes to finish a meal, the sensation of satiety will arrive too late to be of any use. So slow down and pay attention to what your body—and not just your sense of sight—is telling you. ([Location 594](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002YJK5L4&location=594))

#### 49 Eat slowly.
- Eat slowly enough to savor your food; you’ll need less of it to feel satisfied. ([Location 600](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002YJK5L4&location=600))
- Another strategy, encoded in a table manner that’s been all but forgotten: “Put down your fork between bites.” ([Location 604](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002YJK5L4&location=604))
#### 50 “The banquet is in the first bite.”
- No other bite will taste as good as the first, and every subsequent bite will progressively diminish in satisfaction. ([Location 608](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002YJK5L4&location=608))
    - Tags: [[favorite]] 
- as you go on, you’ll be getting more calories, but not necessarily more pleasure. ([Location 610](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002YJK5L4&location=610))
#### 51 Spend as much time enjoying the meal as it took to prepare it.
#### 52 Buy smaller plates and glasses.
- One researcher found that simply switching from a twelve-inch to a ten-inch dinner plate caused people to reduce their consumption by 22 percent. ([Location 619](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002YJK5L4&location=619))
#### 53 Serve a proper portion and don’t go back for seconds.
- you should eat no more food at a meal than would fit into the bowl formed by your hands when cupped together. ([Location 624](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002YJK5L4&location=624))
    - Tags: [[favorite]] 
#### 54 “Breakfast like a king, lunch like a prince, dinner like a pauper.”
#### 55 Eat meals.
- In theory, grazing—eating five or six small meals over the course of the day—makes sense, but in practice people eating this way often end up eating more, and eating more processed snack foods. ([Location 642](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002YJK5L4&location=642))
#### 56 Limit your snacks to unprocessed plant foods.
- If you are going to snack, try to limit yourself to fruits, vegetables, and nuts. ([Location 649](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002YJK5L4&location=649))
    - Tags: [[health]] 
#### 57 Don’t get your fuel from the same place your car does.
#### 58 Do all your eating at a table.
- If we eat while we’re working, or while watching TV or driving, we eat mindlessly—and as a result eat a lot more than we would if we were eating at a table, paying attention to what we’re doing. ([Location 659](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002YJK5L4&location=659))
- When eating somewhere other than at a table, stick to fruits and vegetables. ([Location 662](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002YJK5L4&location=662))
    - Tags: [[health]] [[favorite]] 
#### 59 Try not to eat alone.
- When we eat alone, we eat more. But regulating appetite is only part of the story: The shared meal elevates eating from a biological process of fueling the body to a ritual of family and community. ([Location 669](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002YJK5L4&location=669))
#### 60 Treat treats as treats.
- Some people follow a so-called S policy: “no snacks, no seconds, no sweets—except on days that begin with the letter S.” ([Location 680](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002YJK5L4&location=680))
    - Tags: [[favorite]] 
#### 61 Leave something on your plate.
#### 62 Plant a vegetable garden if you have the space, a window box if you don’t.
- (according to the National Gardening Association, a seventy-dollar investment in a vegetable garden will yield six hundred dollars’ worth of food); ([Location 695](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002YJK5L4&location=695))
#### 63 Cook.
- decline in home cooking closely parallels the rise in obesity, and research suggests that people who cook are more likely to eat a more healthful diet. ([Location 703](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002YJK5L4&location=703))
#### 64 Break the rules once in a while.
- cultivating a relaxed attitude toward food is important. ([Location 708](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002YJK5L4&location=708))
