### Introduction
- In his book The Pastor in a Secular Age: Ministry to People Who No Longer Need a God, Andrew Root describes our eroding capacity for enchantment as a form of “attention blindness.” ([Location 79](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GFNX75C&location=79))
    - Tags: [[attention]] 
- Our attention helps us see, but it also blinds us. ([Location 87](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GFNX75C&location=87))
- We think religion is a matter of belief. Root points out that something deeper and more fundamental is going on. Faith is a matter of perception. Faith isn’t forcing yourself to believe in unbelievable things; faith is overcoming attentional blindness. Phrased differently, faith is about enchantment or, rather, a re-enchantment: the intentional recovery of a holy capacity to see and experience God in the world. ([Location 95](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GFNX75C&location=95))
- Disenchantment isn’t about disbelief. Disenchantment is a failure to attend. ([Location 111](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GFNX75C&location=111))
- being a good person is a huge part of following Jesus, and I’m even comfortable saying it’s the most important part. But more is required to sustain our vision of goodness decade after decade, especially when the work becomes costly and inconvenient or when we face failure and disillusionment. ([Location 116](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GFNX75C&location=116))
- We’re all feeling lost and unwell. I call this the Ache, and I spend time with my students, as I will with you, mapping the contours of this pain. The Ache is the photographic negative of enchantment, the hole that’s been left in our lives because we’ve turned our attention away from God. The Ache is our disenchantment with disenchantment, our doubts about our doubts, our skepticism about being so skeptical. ([Location 121](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GFNX75C&location=121))
    - Tags: [[definition]] 
- For my students, disenchantment reduces their faith to morality or political action. But morality and politics don’t heal the Ache, not fully or completely. ([Location 127](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GFNX75C&location=127))
- The issue is the difference between belief and experience. Belief is intellectual assent and agreement with the doctrinal propositions of faith. Experience exists prior to and drives belief. Experience gives birth to belief. It’s hard to “believe” in God if belief isn’t naming something in our lives, something we’ve felt, sensed, seen, or intuited. ([Location 163](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GFNX75C&location=163))
- Without an experience of God, belief has no content, no reference, no object. No way to get to “Yes!” Demanding belief without experience is asking people to believe in nothing, for the word God would be hanging in thin air, pointing to a gaping hole in a person’s life. ([Location 168](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GFNX75C&location=168))
- It could be that we’re not growing more disenchanted but that we’re undergoing a change in enchantments. ([Location 174](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GFNX75C&location=174))
- Consequently, what is often taken as evidence for disenchantment might actually be a shifting of enchantments. We can describe this shift as a movement away from a religious enchantment toward a spiritual enchantment, creating the growing “spiritual but not religious” phenomenon. By religious enchantment, I mean an encounter with sacred transcendence, God existing outside, above, and beyond the cosmos. By spiritual enchantment, I mean—as Steven Smith describes in his book Pagans and Christians in the City—an immanent encounter with the sacred, the divine located within creation itself. For our conversation, disenchantment names both the rise of unbelief generally along with a movement away from a religious enchantment, an encounter with a transcendent Creator. ([Location 194](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GFNX75C&location=194))
    - Tags: [[definition]] 
- There are enchantments that Christians should be worried about and avoid. So when we speak of re-enchanting faith, we need to attend to the potential for misenchantment. ([Location 201](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GFNX75C&location=201))
- The fear is that if we lean too heavily on our experiences, our faith will be blown about by our whims and fancies. And that’s absolutely true; experience must be checked or all sorts of bad things can happen. We need to discern the spirits and heed the exhortation of 1 John 4:1: “Beloved, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they are from God.” You and I will kick the tires of the various enchantments on offer in the world in order to separate God’s enchantment from the kooky, the dangerous, and the self-indulgent. ([Location 203](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GFNX75C&location=203))
### Part 1 Attention Blindness
#### 1 The Slow Death of God
- Facts have never been a threat to faith—the more facts, the merrier!—but science changed our vision, how we beheld and perceived the world. ([Location 265](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GFNX75C&location=265))
- While God is everywhere, without visible and visual reminders of God’s presence, we’re going to struggle in our disenchanted age to remember that God is even there at all. When faith is a matter of attention, we need visual cues to capture and captivate our hearts and minds. ([Location 335](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GFNX75C&location=335))
- Days weren’t measured by “working nine to five”; they were marked by prayers offered at fixed times throughout the day: • Vigil (said at around 2 a.m.) • Lauds (said at dawn) • Prime (said during the “First Hour,” around 6 a.m.) • Terce (said during the “Third Hour,” around 9 a.m.) • Sext (said during the “Sixth Hour,” around noon) • None (said during the “Ninth Hour,” around 3 p.m.) • Vespers (said “at the lighting of the lamps,” about 6 p.m.) • Compline (said before going to bed, around 7 p.m.) ([Location 347](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GFNX75C&location=347))
    - Tags: [[inbox]] 
- Our “holy days” have been reduced to “holidays,” time off granted by employers rather than seasons hallowed by our faith. ([Location 363](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GFNX75C&location=363))
- There are deep and important reasons why Protestantism applies the word saint to each and every believer, but it’s also true that when everyone is a saint, no one is a saint. ([Location 372](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GFNX75C&location=372))
- In many ways, Protestantism has been a journey from the mystical to the moral. This mystical-to-moral shift has played a significant role in disenchanting the world. I think it’s had a bigger impact on faith than the Scientific Revolution. If God is slowly dying, it’s because Christians stopped seeking God and started to focus on being good. ([Location 404](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GFNX75C&location=404))
- the younger generations in our pews generally assume that the entire point of being a Christian is to “be like Jesus,” which is Christian speak for “being a good person.” As I’ve said, my conservative and progressive students have very different visions of what “being like Jesus” looks like. But either way, they equate Christianity with their moral and political performance. And once this move is made, once Christianity is reduced to moral hygiene or social justice, it’s just a short hop to question the usefulness of rolling out of bed on a Sunday morning to go to church or the meaningfulness of believing in God. ([Location 439](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GFNX75C&location=439))
- Millennials and Gen Zers are more progressive than their parents and grandparents, more tolerant and inclusive on the issues of gender, race, and sexuality. So if the point of following Jesus is being a loving, tolerant person, then there’s little attraction with a church they associate with sexism, racism, and homophobia. ([Location 445](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GFNX75C&location=445))
- These two things—seeing the world as a machine and reducing Christianity to morality—disenchanted the world. Each in their own way made God distant and unnecessary. ([Location 456](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GFNX75C&location=456))
#### 2 Welcome to the Ache
- In medicine, there’s a theory of illness called the “vulnerability-stress model.” We become ill when a stressor intersects with a vulnerability. ([Location 483](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GFNX75C&location=483))
    - Tags: [[definition]] 
- Social media, politics, and economic strain are stressors rather than causes. We’d be able to better handle these stressors if we were more healthy and resilient. But we’re not healthy or resilient: we’re vulnerable, struggling to cope, and our happiness and peace of mind are increasingly fragile. Let’s explore this vulnerability. I’d like us to get to the root of what is causing us so much pain. As I’ve shared, with my students I call it the Ache. ([Location 487](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GFNX75C&location=487))
    - Tags: [[definition]] 
- God may be dead, but we sure do miss him. ([Location 492](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GFNX75C&location=492))
- if your entire life has been devoted to putting question marks next to everything—especially the things you hold most sacred—is it any wonder we’re all feeling a bit fragile and anxious? I think it’s time to question some of those question marks. ([Location 511](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GFNX75C&location=511))
- Of course, the existence of the Ache is no proof for the existence of God. But tracing the Ache does cultivate a restlessness, a desire and longing for God. A spiritual thirst. Evoking this thirst is the first step back toward enchantment. It might be hard for us to believe in God, but it’s very obvious that we desire God. And that desire is a prayer and a cry for help. ([Location 514](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GFNX75C&location=514))
- For human life to remain human, some things have to be preserved and cherished as holy and sacred, absolutely immune to commodification and exploitation. Many of us feel this most intensely when it comes to the natural world. ([Location 540](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GFNX75C&location=540))
- The great hypocrisy of our skeptical age is that its greatest moral accomplishment—a moral vision founded upon universal human rights—depends on enchantment, a belief in the sacred character of human beings and life. ([Location 548](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GFNX75C&location=548))
- When redwood trees lose their sacred magic, it becomes very easy to cut them down. And the same goes for human beings. ([Location 562](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GFNX75C&location=562))
- Hallowing is an old word, but I love it. To hallow is to make or declare something as holy and sacred. ([Location 568](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GFNX75C&location=568))
    - Tags: [[definition]] 
- The reason we say “I’ll pray for you,” even if we don’t believe in prayer or have serious doubts about the efficacy of prayer, is that when we face great pain, we feel compelled to hallow it, to set it apart from the normal stuff of daily life. And hallowing is enchanting. ([Location 569](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GFNX75C&location=569))
- If our suffering is meaningless, we find the pain intolerable, and we cannot bear or carry it. But if our suffering is meaningful, if we can connect our pain to some purpose, we find the strength to carry on. ([Location 606](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GFNX75C&location=606))
- psychologists have begun to study a variable called mattering. Mattering is, quite simply, the belief and conviction that you matter, that your life has cosmic significance regardless of external circumstances. ([Location 629](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GFNX75C&location=629))
- But mattering is a form of enchantment, a conviction that, in some mystical way, the cosmos sees you and honors your pain and struggles. Your emotional and mental well-being rests upon this bit of magic. Because the conviction that you matter is nonsense when considered from a purely factual point of view. ([Location 633](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GFNX75C&location=633))
- once we locate our true self, we set it as our North Star. We draft a life mission statement, identify our strengths, pick our “word for the year,” and then set our course. We obtain meaning and purpose by living authentically, by staying true to ourselves. But therein lies a problem. I don’t know if you’ve noticed, but it can be pretty hard to disentangle your inner demons from your true self. ([Location 672](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GFNX75C&location=672))
- The thing to see here is that the modern, disenchanted self is a neurotic self, a self that is both self-absorbed and deeply unstable and unsettled. When the modern world turned inward for meaning, direction, and purpose—when we turned away from God to raise the banner of authenticity—we made a devil’s bargain. In declaring our independence from God, we became anxious and neurotic. ([Location 689](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GFNX75C&location=689))
- What have we seen on our tour of the Ache? This: We are deeply dissatisfied with disenchantment. Disenchantment is making us sick, and we recoil in horror at the world it has given us, a world stripped of its holy, sacred character. We need to hallow. We need to pray. We need creation to be a church—sacred, holy, and set apart. We need to matter in the face of failure and heartbreak. And we need a North Star more constant than ourselves. ([Location 695](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GFNX75C&location=695))
### Part 2 Enchanted Faith
#### 3 Eccentric Experiences
- Religious experiences are like Peter Parker’s “spider sense,” a sacred tingling we feel when God has just shown up. When we widen our view and don’t reduce God to visions, voices, and angelic visitations, we discover that we bump into God all the time. Slowly, if we practice paying attention, we come to see the dancing gorilla right in front of us. ([Location 746](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GFNX75C&location=746))
- The first characteristic of an encounter with God is one I’ve already mentioned: ineffability. Religious experiences are hard to put into words. There’s something about encountering God that defies verbal description. ([Location 757](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GFNX75C&location=757))
- Music, art, poetry, and architecture, along with the wonders of the natural world, are much better equipped to capture and communicate the ineffable nature of spiritual insights and truths. Our faith will struggle when it becomes excessively verbal and rational. ([Location 762](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GFNX75C&location=762))
- Disenchantment is often a sign that you’ve lost touch with the aesthetic, ineffable aspects of faith. If you’re struggling with disenchantment, odds are you’re thinking rather than paying attention. ([Location 765](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GFNX75C&location=765))
- Pascal’s mystical experience—his encounter with a “FIRE” that filled him with joy—illustrates the second feature of religious experiences. Mystical experiences are transitory and short lived. ([Location 804](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GFNX75C&location=804))
- for many of us, religious experiences are more like lightning strikes—sharp, quick flashes of perception and awareness that briefly illuminate our lives. Sometimes the experience is soft and gentle, like a lightning bug on a summer evening, glowing for an instant and then fading back to darkness. ([Location 806](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GFNX75C&location=806))
- We can experience what St. John of the Cross called a “dark night of the soul,” where our spiritual lives are characterized by a sharp sense of God’s absence. During these seasons, enchantment becomes a discipline of memory. ([Location 813](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GFNX75C&location=813))
- The fact that we can’t force or control these moments highlights the third feature of mystical experiences. William James called it “passivity.” What James means by passivity is that we can’t make the moment happen; the moment happens to us. Something from outside of ourselves grabs or interrupts us. Mystical experiences are not manufactured; they are received. ([Location 822](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GFNX75C&location=822))
- The fourth and last mark of mystical experiences is that these moments possess what William James calls a “noetic quality.” The word noetic comes from the Greek word noeó, meaning “to perceive, see, or understand.” This is the word Jesus uses a lot in the gospels when his disciples cannot see a point he is trying to make. “Do you not see?” Jesus repeatedly asks his disciples. Mystical experiences are not emotional highs; they are revelations. As William James describes it, mystical experiences are felt to be “states of knowledge . . . insight into depths of truths unplumbed” by our minds and intelligence. Mystical experiences are “illuminations, revelations, full of significance and importance.” ([Location 833](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GFNX75C&location=833))
- The biblical word for the noetic quality of mystical experiences is apocalypse. ([Location 845](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GFNX75C&location=845))
- Mystical experiences are apocalypses, revelations, and unveilings, windows into a deeper reality. ([Location 847](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GFNX75C&location=847))
- Sometimes the apocalypse is a revelation about your identity, an assurance of God’s love. ([Location 853](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GFNX75C&location=853))
- sometimes bumping into God places a calling on lives, gives us a mission. ([Location 863](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GFNX75C&location=863))
- these revelations can be experienced as moral convictions, moments that expose how our love needs to expand, to embrace those whom we’ve ignored or excluded. ([Location 876](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GFNX75C&location=876))
- Assurance, mission, and conviction. Walking through these religious experiences in the Bible and in our lives illustrates the diversity of the perceptions and insights that are graced to us. If we widen our view about what a mystical experience might feel like, my hunch is that if we inventory our lives, we’ve had many such moments. ([Location 888](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GFNX75C&location=888))
#### 4 Living in a One-Story Universe
- Theologians have a fancy name for this one-story view of the world. They call it a “sacramental ontology.” Ontology is concerned with “existence,” our thoughts and ideas about “reality.” A good definition of sacrament is “a visible sign of an invisible reality.” Putting the two together, “sacramental ontology” is about how everything around us, everything that exists, points us toward God. All the world is a sign. ([Location 940](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GFNX75C&location=940))
    - Tags: [[definition]] 
#### 5 The Good Catastrophe
- life in the “real world” is often burdened by boredom and weariness. We move numbly from workday to workday, entertainment to entertainment, screen to screen. Worst of all, our relationships become affected by a “taken for granted” feeling. We confess the tragedy of this, the monotony we feel with others, even with those we love most dearly. But we struggle to regain contact with wonder, surprise, and awe. ([Location 1008](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GFNX75C&location=1008))
- Enchantment is the daily work of “cleaning the dirty windows” of our perceptions so that the familiar surprises us again with joy, wonder, and gratitude. ([Location 1033](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GFNX75C&location=1033))
    - Note: No wonder psychics often give a religious experience
- The windows of our perception become dirty when we own, master, and possess the world. ([Location 1035](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GFNX75C&location=1035))
- Triteness, Tolkien says, is the penalty of appropriation, taking something as your own. Boredom is the price of possessiveness. Monotony is the cost of acquiring and hoarding. ([Location 1035](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GFNX75C&location=1035))
- The most resilient men are those who continue to express gratitude, to experience life as a gift, even in the midst of their difficult circumstances. ([Location 1119](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GFNX75C&location=1119))
    - Tags: [[resilient]] 
- If you doubt the transformative power of gratitude, try this experiment. Pick anything in your life that is a source of dissatisfaction. Maybe it’s your old smartphone with its bad battery, your junky car, or a less-than-satisfying job. Now make it a practice over the next few days to express heartfelt thanks for your phone, car, job, or anything else in your life. Be thankful that you have a phone, or a car, or a job. Millions of people don’t have any of these things. So take time this week, as the old hymn exhorts, to “count your blessings.” Then sit back and watch the psychological magic do its work. Notice, when you count your blessings, how a source of dissatisfaction is transformed into a location of joy. Now imagine extending this thankfulness across every sphere of your life. Imagine what it would be like to experience everything in life—every moment, every possession, every task, every relationship—as gift and grace. It would be absolutely transformative. No wonder gratitude makes people happy. ([Location 1121](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GFNX75C&location=1121))
    - Tags: [[reflection]] 
- Gratitude has this eccentric shape because it is a social and relational emotion, the positive feelings we experience when we’ve been given a gift or favor. Gifts imply a giver. So when we feel grateful for the beauty of nature and for life itself, our feelings (if not our minds) assume we’re in a personal relationship with the cosmos. Our emotions assume a Gift Giver. ([Location 1132](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GFNX75C&location=1132))
- You can’t be grateful for existence and be an atheist at the same time, at least not emotionally. ([Location 1136](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GFNX75C&location=1136))
- unlike gratitude, feeling lucky isn’t a foundation of emotional and mental health. In fact, feeling lucky can cut in the opposite direction. ([Location 1143](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GFNX75C&location=1143))
- Regardless, the thing to note is how feeling lucky always has this potential to tip into despair. Gratitude, by contrast, causes us to feel blessed and graced, welcome and at home in the universe. You are not a cosmic accident; you were meant to be here. ([Location 1153](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GFNX75C&location=1153))
- What’s gone wrong is that the marketed cure is a poison. Our problem is self-esteem. Because at its heart, self-esteem is an evaluation: How am I measuring up? We answer this question in one of two ways. First, we compare ourselves to others. ... Second, when we’re not comparing ourselves to the lives of others, we judge our self-esteem by assessing our performance in meeting our goals and expectations. ([Location 1168](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GFNX75C&location=1168))
- it’s really no wonder we’re all so unhealthy and unhappy. We’ve told ourselves that a healthy self-esteem is the surest route to happiness, but self-esteem is rooted in evaluation, comparison, and performance. Linking our psychological health to our ability to compare well to others and succeed has been a complete disaster. ([Location 1180](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GFNX75C&location=1180))
- We need to experience our lives and actions as significant and valuable regardless of situation and circumstance. As we’ve learned, psychologists have a name for this; it’s called mattering, the steady conviction that your life and actions have value regardless of present circumstances. ([Location 1188](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GFNX75C&location=1188))
    - Tags: [[definition]] 
- Mattering allows our value to escape the trap of self-esteem, swinging between its highs and lows. ([Location 1190](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GFNX75C&location=1190))
- Dignity is an enchantment, a religious conviction. Shame is a religious problem. Do you believe you matter? Because at the end of the day, our worth is simply a gift we have to receive. Mattering is grace. This is the enchantment that guards our hearts and minds, buffering us from failure and shame. ([Location 1220](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GFNX75C&location=1220))
- In this skeptical age, fairy stories are resistance literature, pointing us toward the spiritual revolution that will save our lives from boredom, deadness, hopelessness, dissatisfaction, nihilism, and despair. ([Location 1264](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GFNX75C&location=1264))
### Part 3 Enchanted Christianities
#### 6 Liturgical Enchantments
- I’ve described how we can re-enchant our faith in this skeptical age. We can pay closer attention to the “strange sights,” the many ways God speaks to us, every day, through religious experiences. We can pray prayers of Thanks, Help, and Wow to recover a sacramental ontology, where God is everywhere present in our one-story universe. And we can make the outward turns of hope, joy, gratitude, and mattering to receive the grace that comes to us as a gift. ([Location 1303](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GFNX75C&location=1303))
    - Tags: [[favorite]] 
- The Protestant temptation to draw a hard line between the spiritual and the material regulates the spiritual to the invisible and unseen. This strict separation facilitates disenchantment as the visible, material world comes to be viewed as “real” and the unseen, spiritual world as “unreal.” ([Location 1320](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GFNX75C&location=1320))
- Beauty, natural or cultivated, prompts feelings of wonder, awe, and transcendence. ([Location 1331](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GFNX75C&location=1331))
- In this skeptical world, it’s easy for me to forget about God without physical, material reminders. So take a look at the spaces you inhabit. Your home, car, office. Look at what you wear around your neck, wrists, and fingers. Do you see material reminders of spiritual realities? If not, take some steps to enchant your world. ([Location 1341](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GFNX75C&location=1341))
- Beyond the material enchantments of beauty and the use of sacramentals helping us enchant space, liturgical traditions also help us enchant time. ([Location 1345](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GFNX75C&location=1345))
- Usher your heart and mind through sacred seasons and holy days. Wait during Advent. Celebrate during Christmas, all twelve days of it! Fast during Lent and party during Easter. Let God show you what time it is. ([Location 1373](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GFNX75C&location=1373))
#### 7 Contemplative Enchantments
- at its heart, the contemplative tradition emphasizes attention and awareness. This is exactly what we need if disenchantment is fundamentally a form of “attention blindness,” ([Location 1412](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GFNX75C&location=1412))
- But awareness of God’s presence doesn’t emerge out of thin air. Awareness is effortful and practiced. Consequently, the contemplative tradition also points us toward spiritual disciplines. ([Location 1414](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GFNX75C&location=1414))
- Both enchantment and disenchantment are habits, habits of attention or inattention, awareness or obliviousness. ([Location 1415](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GFNX75C&location=1415))

- “Roses and thorns” is an example of the Ignatian practice of examen. ([Location 1426](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GFNX75C&location=1426))
- Similar to Brother Lawrence’s The Practice of the Presence of God, Ignatius’s Spiritual Exercises is considered to be one of the crown jewels of the contemplative tradition, a how-to handbook for contemplation. ([Location 1428](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GFNX75C&location=1428))
- As originally envisioned by Ignatius, the spiritual exercises involve a four-week retreat with a spiritual director, what Jesuits call “the long retreat.” However, the “four weeks” of the exercises are meant to be flexible, four movements rather than literal weeks. Most laypeople spread the “four weeks” across many months. ([Location 1430](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GFNX75C&location=1430))
    - Note: Still, this doesn’t seem to be a reasonable expectation for Christians and I am wary of Spiritual Direction. We should build it into what we are doing in Christian community. It’s a symptom of our modern consumptive individualism, in some way.
- The point of the Spiritual Exercises is cultivating an attentiveness, awareness, openness, and receptivity toward God. ([Location 1435](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GFNX75C&location=1435))
- In the Ignatian tradition, these roses and thorns are called consolations and desolations. Emotions are our key guide in this process. When during the day did you feel angry, irritated, stressed, impatient, anxious, agitated, tense, ashamed, defeated, sad, guilty, depressed, or worthless? These are the moments of desolation, the thorns. By contrast, when during your day did you feel peaceful, joyful, relaxed, happy, and whole? These are the roses, the moments of consolation. ([Location 1441](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GFNX75C&location=1441))
- The goal of examen isn’t to tally up your sins and failures from the day. The focus of examen is discernment. Where in my day am I being drawn toward God? And when am I being pulled away? When you’re disciplined in praying the prayer of examen, you’ll begin to note patterns in your life. You’ll notice how the roses and thorns tend to cluster around certain places, people, times, and activities. As you make these observations, you can begin to make adjustments, really leaning into and savoring the moments of consolation while becoming more intentional about addressing what triggers the moments of desolation.

- Because if we don’t pay attention, our emotional default will be to gaze upon these strangers with loathing and anger. ([Location 1476](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GFNX75C&location=1476))
- roses can bloom where before only thorns were found. With your attention, you get to decide in those moments what to worship. ([Location 1493](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GFNX75C&location=1493))
- Sometimes it’s hard to “pay attention” without a physical object to hold and to guide or focus us. Feeling prayer beads in my pocket or seeing the prayer rope on my wrist can trigger and recall my attention back to practicing the presence of God.

- But let’s not mistake the means for the end. Practicing the presence of God, the Ignatian practice of examen, the Jesus Prayer, the fixed-hour prayer, and the spiritual disciplines are tools of contemplation, time-tested methods that bring us face-to-face with the mystery of God. Prayer practices and spiritual disciplines aren’t pietistic activities we do in order to be “good Christians.” They are tools to facilitate an encounter with God. ([Location 1533](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GFNX75C&location=1533))
- Instead of an encounter with God, we have ideas about God. Too many words about God—too much talking, reading, and listening about God—can disenchant our faith. ([Location 1540](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GFNX75C&location=1540))
- Prayer is that place where we become disciplined in setting words and ideas aside in the face of the mystery. ([Location 1542](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GFNX75C&location=1542))
#### 8 Charismatic Enchantments
- for decades, my spiritual life consisted of reading and thinking hard about God and Scripture. Eventually, though, and perhaps ironically, this pursuit slowly eroded my faith. I was, to put it plainly, too much in my head. The wheels wouldn’t stop spinning. I couldn’t pray because prayer was one of the things I had questions about. I couldn’t worship, because I had too many theological disagreements with the lyrics of the songs we were singing. I walked away from sermon after sermon with long lists of questions and objections. Over time, I’d cut myself off from God, trapping myself in a prison of words and ideas. ([Location 1572](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GFNX75C&location=1572))
- Eventually it dawned upon me that this intellectual quest was making me spiritually sick. God wasn’t a Rubik’s Cube to solve but a living reality to encounter. ([Location 1577](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GFNX75C&location=1577))
- By charismatic or pentecostal, I mean a strongly felt experience of the Holy Spirit’s presence and activity in our lives, often through “signs and wonders.” In response to God’s presence and activity, charismatic and pentecostal worship is characterized by full-bodied, energetic, and emotional praise, thanksgiving, and testimony. ([Location 1599](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GFNX75C&location=1599))

- Charismatic spirituality flourishes among the poor and the oppressed in America and across the world. In the West, the educated and affluent struggle mightily with disenchantment and skepticism. Western elites are crippled by their religious doubts. Just as I was before I started attending Freedom. But enchantment thrives on the margins of society. ([Location 1604](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GFNX75C&location=1604))
- Charismatic spirituality has its temptations, excesses, and blind spots. But so does the detached, critical, and skeptical faith of disenchanted privileged elites. And in my experience, the temptations of disenchantment are far more dangerous. ([Location 1613](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GFNX75C&location=1613))
- I find the excesses of charismatic theology easily addressable, a simple matter of inserting some critical nuance and attending to the lament and brokenness of life. Disenchantment, by contrast, is a faith killer. ([Location 1616](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GFNX75C&location=1616))
- Doubting, skeptical, and disenchanted Christians struggle mightily with miracles. Locked in their heads by chains of analytical reasoning, many disenchanted Christians attack miracle stories with a battery of questions. Every miracle story is fiercely interrogated as a “more rational” explanation is sought. ([Location 1633](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GFNX75C&location=1633))
- What I learned at Freedom is that miracle stories are a hermeneutics of gratitude. ([Location 1642](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GFNX75C&location=1642))
- in his book Thinking in Tongues, James Smith describes the heart of charismatic spirituality as standing in “a position of radical openness to God, and in particular, God doing something differently or new.” This charismatic posture is a posture of receptivity. ([Location 1644](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GFNX75C&location=1644))
- Miracle stories, I came to understand, are a practice of attention, the charismatic habit of noticing how grace and rescue flow through every moment of your life, even the smallest and most insignificant. ([Location 1648](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GFNX75C&location=1648))
- This is why I described miracle stories as hermeneutical, as an interpretive activity. You can tell the story of your life in any number of ways. ([Location 1653](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GFNX75C&location=1653))
- Like miracle stories, spiritual warfare is hard for the skeptical and disenchanted. ([Location 1677](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GFNX75C&location=1677))
- Jesus was the GOAT of social justice warriors, the Greatest of All Time. Outside of this very narrow moral and political understanding of Christianity, I didn’t have much time for the spookier, more enchanted aspects of the faith. ([Location 1681](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GFNX75C&location=1681))
- Christian enchantment isn’t spacey supernaturalism, emotional uplift, or credulous kookiness. There is a whole lot of that stuff going around, and I’m going to talk about it. But the point I want to emphasize here is that Christian enchantment is a struggle, a call to battle. One of the gifts of the charismatic tradition is how it helps us recover this vision, this call to “spiritual warfare.” ([Location 1691](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GFNX75C&location=1691))
- In a disenchanted world, the only actors left on the stage are human beings. This moralizes and politicizes our faith. ([Location 1695](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GFNX75C&location=1695))
- I understand how skeptical Christians might struggle with how to envision this “third power.” Let me suggest that we don’t get too literal and simply pay attention to the world around us. When you pay attention, what you come to realize is that every inch of your life and every moment of your day is hotly contested territory. There is no neutral ground. We are always standing at a moral and spiritual crossroads. ([Location 1699](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GFNX75C&location=1699))
- However you want to imagine it, there’s a “third power” out there, relentlessly seeking to devour us. The darkness is always close at hand, one catastrophic choice away. So let’s do what the charismatics do: let’s pray for help and stay awake. ([Location 1718](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GFNX75C&location=1718))
- James Smith makes the observation that sexism may be one of the reasons so many men are judgmental and dismissive of emotional praise music. Much of this emotionalism in praise and worship music has been dismissed as too “romantic” and even “erotic,” sneered at as “Jesus is my boyfriend” music. ([Location 1746](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GFNX75C&location=1746))
#### 9 Celtic Enchantments
- the Desert Fathers were hugely influential upon the Celtic saints. ([Location 1845](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GFNX75C&location=1845))
- If enchantment involves a recovery of a sacramental imagination, the Celtic tradition illustrates how poetry is a spiritual practice and a resource for re-enchantment. ([Location 1918](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GFNX75C&location=1918))
- Where the contemplative tradition gives us prayer as a practice of attention, the Celtic tradition gives us poetry. ([Location 1919](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GFNX75C&location=1919))
- This sacramental imagery of dependency is an enchanted posture because, once again, it is an eccentric posture: as a needy child, we see the lie of self-sufficiency. We confess that we cannot exist alone in isolation from the Source that gives us life. Dependency embodies the outward turn as we look for succor, care, affection, love, and nurturing from the outside. Dependency enchants because it is the ache and need that causes us to search for and lean upon God. Maternal imagery for God focuses our attention on our childlike dependence as we gaze into the face of the God who is our Mother. ([Location 1949](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GFNX75C&location=1949))
- There is a lot of stuff on the market under the label “Celtic Christianity” that really is just pop paganism for Christians. And it can be hard to tell the difference. There’s a delicate balance between recognizing nature as sacred and worthy of reverence and outright nature worship. But anyone who reduces Celtic Christianity to nature worship has woefully misjudged the Irish saints. ([Location 1964](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GFNX75C&location=1964))
- Creation isn’t the divine Presence; creation mediates the divine Presence. ([Location 1968](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GFNX75C&location=1968))
- Given that enchantment is a practice of attention, where we bring to mind spiritual realities, ascetical practices like fasting are some of the biggest tools at our disposal. ([Location 2003](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GFNX75C&location=2003))
- As Charles Taylor said, our modern experience of the self is “buffered,” a self that stands alone, autonomous, and isolated, walled off from the outside world. This buffered self doesn’t need protection. But it’s precisely here where the Celtic breastplate prayers can help us. Prayers of Help recover enchantment because they draw our attention away from autonomy and self-sufficiency to focus on our vulnerability. When we hold this vulnerability before God in prayer, our experience becomes more Celtic and enchanted. ([Location 2073](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GFNX75C&location=2073))
- Here’s our problem: it’s easy to experience enchantment on vacation. Anyone can feel a bit Celtic visiting Ireland or Wales. Anyone can feel closer to God on a beach or hiking in a national park. I don’t want to dismiss the restorative, spiritual magic of these beautiful places. We need these natural wonders and how they help us find God in nature. ... But if we only experience the enchantment of the natural world on vacation, I think we’ve missed the lesson the Celtic saints were teaching us. ... But no matter where you live, the encouragement of the Celtic saints is this: enchant the place where you find yourself, right where you are standing.

### Part 4 Discerning the Spirits
#### 10 Enchantment Shifting
- When people turn away from traditional religious observance, they don’t generally opt for atheism. They dabble in crystals, herbs, oils, meditation, yoga, astrology, and New Age spiritualism, shopping around to forge their own unique path forward. __Nothing could be more American than this “design your own” approach to religion and faith.__ ([Location 2134](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GFNX75C&location=2134))
- I am calling us toward a more mystical and experiential Christianity. But there are dangers and temptations here that need to be addressed and resisted. If we’re not very careful, a more “spiritual” Christianity can quickly devolve into something spacey and sentimental. ([Location 2142](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GFNX75C&location=2142))
- If our faith is to pay more attention to spiritual and mystical experience, then it also has to be equipped to “discern the spirits.” ([Location 2145](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GFNX75C&location=2145))
