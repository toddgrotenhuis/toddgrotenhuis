## Highlights
- His questions can be asked about all technologies and media. What happens to us when we become infatuated with and then seduced by them? Do they free us or imprison us? Do they improve or degrade democracy? Do they make our leaders more accountable or less so? Our system more transparent or less so? Do they make us better citizens or better consumers? Are the trade-offs worth it? If they’re not worth it, yet we still can’t stop ourselves from embracing the next new thing because that’s just how we’re wired, then what strategies can we devise to maintain control? Dignity? Meaning? ([Location 191](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0023ZLLH6&location=191))
- This book is about the possibility that Huxley, not Orwell, was right. ([Location 245](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0023ZLLH6&location=245))
### Part I.
#### 1. The Medium Is the Metaphor
- Our politics, religion, news, athletics, education and commerce have been transformed into congenial adjuncts of show business, largely without protest or even much popular notice. The result is that we are a people on the verge of amusing ourselves to death. ([Location 260](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0023ZLLH6&location=260))
- There is no shortage of critics who have observed and recorded the dissolution of public discourse in America and its conversion into the arts of show business. But most of them, I believe, have barely begun to tell the story of the origin and meaning of this descent into a vast triviality. ([Location 290](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0023ZLLH6&location=290))
- It is an argument that fixes its attention on the forms of human conversation, and postulates that how we are obliged to conduct such conversations will have the strongest possible influence on what ideas we can conveniently express. And what ideas are convenient to express inevitably become the important content of a culture. ([Location 300](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0023ZLLH6&location=300))
- For on television, discourse is conducted largely through visual imagery, which is to say that television gives us a conversation in images, not words. The emergence of the image-manager in the political arena and the concomitant decline of the speech writer attest to the fact that television demands a different kind of content from other media. You cannot do political philosophy on television. Its form works against the content. ([Location 314](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0023ZLLH6&location=314))
- We attend to fragments of events from all over the world because we have multiple media whose forms are well suited to fragmented conversation. ([Location 324](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0023ZLLH6&location=324))
- the clearest way to see through a culture is to attend to its tools for conversation. ([Location 335](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0023ZLLH6&location=335))
- People like ourselves who are in the process of converting their culture from word-centered to image-centered might profit by reflecting on this Mosaic injunction. ([Location 346](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0023ZLLH6&location=346))
- We know enough about language to understand that variations in the structures of languages will result in variations in what may be called “world view.” How people think about time and space, and about things and processes, will be greatly influenced by the grammatical features of their language. ([Location 351](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0023ZLLH6&location=351))
- Each medium, like language itself, makes possible a unique mode of discourse by providing a new orientation for thought, for expression, for sensibility. ([Location 356](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0023ZLLH6&location=356))
- person who reads a book or who watches television or who glances at his watch is not usually interested in how his mind is organized and controlled by these events, still less in what idea of the world is suggested by a book, television, or a watch. ([Location 368](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0023ZLLH6&location=368))
- In Mumford’s great book Technics and Civilization, he shows how, beginning in the fourteenth century, the clock made us into time-keepers, and then time-savers, and now time-servers. In the process, we have learned irreverence toward the sun and the seasons, for in a world made up of seconds and minutes, the authority of nature is superseded. ([Location 377](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0023ZLLH6&location=377))
- Nonetheless, it is clear that phonetic writing created a new conception of knowledge, as well as a new sense of intelligence, of audience and of posterity, all of which Plato recognized at an early stage in the development of texts. ([Location 386](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0023ZLLH6&location=386))
- Writing freezes speech and in so doing gives birth to the grammarian, the logician, the rhetorician, the historian, the scientist—all those who must hold language before them so that they can see what it means, where it errs, and where it is leading. ([Location 391](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0023ZLLH6&location=391))
- what my book is about is how our own tribe is undergoing a vast and trembling shift from the magic of writing to the magic of electronics. ([Location 407](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0023ZLLH6&location=407))
- metaphor. We are told in school, quite correctly, that a metaphor suggests what a thing is like by comparing it to something else. And by the power of its suggestion, it so fixes a conception in our minds that we cannot imagine the one thing without the other: ([Location 410](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0023ZLLH6&location=410))
- in every tool we create, an idea is embedded that goes beyond the function of the thing itself. ([Location 419](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0023ZLLH6&location=419))
- Eyeglasses refuted the belief that anatomy is destiny by putting forward the idea that our bodies as well as our minds are improvable. ([Location 421](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0023ZLLH6&location=421))
- And our languages are our media. Our media are our metaphors. Our metaphors create the content of our culture. ([Location 436](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0023ZLLH6&location=436))
#### 2. Media as Epistemology
- It is my intention in this book to show that a great media-metaphor shift has taken place in America, with the result that the content of much of our public discourse has become dangerous nonsense. ([Location 439](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0023ZLLH6&location=439))
- I raise no objection to television’s junk. The best things on television are its junk, and no one and nothing is seriously threatened by it. ([Location 447](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0023ZLLH6&location=447))
- Therein is our problem, for television is at its most trivial and, therefore, most dangerous when its aspirations are high, when it presents itself as a carrier of important cultural conversations. ([Location 448](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0023ZLLH6&location=448))
- we do not measure a culture by its output of undisguised trivialities but by what it claims as significant. ([Location 448](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0023ZLLH6&location=448))
- Whatever the original and limited context of its use may have been, a medium has the power to fly far beyond that context into new and unexpected ones. Because of the way it directs us to organize our minds and integrate our experience of the world, it imposes itself on our consciousness and social institutions in myriad forms. It sometimes has the power to become implicated in our concepts of piety, or goodness, or beauty. And it is always implicated in the ways we define and regulate our ideas of truth. ([Location 471](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0023ZLLH6&location=471))
- For in a print-based courtroom, where law books, briefs, citations and other written materials define and organize the method of finding the truth, the oral tradition has lost much of its resonance—but not all of it. Testimony is expected to be given orally, on the assumption that the spoken, not the written, word is a truer reflection of the state of mind of a witness. Indeed, in many courtrooms jurors are not permitted to take notes, nor are they given written copies of the judge’s explanation of the law. Jurors are expected to hear the truth, or its opposite, not to read it. Thus, we may say that there is a clash of resonances in our concept of legal truth. ([Location 493](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0023ZLLH6&location=493))
- the written word is, by its nature, addressed to the world, not an individual. ([Location 521](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0023ZLLH6&location=521))
- The written word endures, the spoken word disappears ; and that is why writing is closer to the truth than speaking. ([Location 522](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0023ZLLH6&location=522))
- the concept of truth is intimately linked to the biases of forms of expression. Truth does not, and never has, come unadorned. It must appear in its proper clothing or it is not acknowledged, which is a way of saying that the “truth” is a kind of cultural prejudice. Each culture conceives of it as being most authentically expressed in certain symbolic forms that another culture may regard as trivial or irrelevant. ([Location 544](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0023ZLLH6&location=544))
- “Seeing is believing” has always had a preeminent status as an epistemological axiom, but “saying is believing,” “reading is believing,” “counting is believing,” “deducing is believing,” and “feeling is believing” are others that have risen or fallen in importance as cultures have undergone media change. ([Location 570](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0023ZLLH6&location=570))

- Since intelligence is primarily defined as one’s capacity to grasp the truth of things, it follows that what a culture means by intelligence is derived from the character of its important forms of communication. ([Location 576](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0023ZLLH6&location=576))
- My argument is limited to saying that a major new medium changes the structure of discourse; it does so by encouraging certain uses of the intellect, by favoring certain definitions of intelligence and wisdom, and by demanding a certain kind of content—in a phrase, by creating new forms of truth-telling. ([Location 613](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0023ZLLH6&location=613))

- I am arguing that a television-based epistemology pollutes public communication and its surrounding landscape, not that it pollutes everything. ([Location 634](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0023ZLLH6&location=634))
- I will try to demonstrate that as typography moves to the periphery of our culture and television takes its place at the center, the seriousness, clarity and, above all, value of public discourse dangerously declines. ([Location 649](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0023ZLLH6&location=649))
#### 3. Typographic America
- The Dunkers came close here to formulating a commandment about religious discourse : Thou shalt not write down thy principles, still less print them, lest thou shall be entrapped by them for all time. ([Location 668](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0023ZLLH6&location=668))
- the Lyceum Movement had as its purpose the diffusion of knowledge, the promotion of common schools, the creation of libraries and, especially, the establishment of lecture halls. ([Location 816](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0023ZLLH6&location=816))
- The influence of the printed word in every arena of public discourse was insistent and powerful not merely because of the quantity of printed matter but because of its monopoly. ([Location 841](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0023ZLLH6&location=841))
#### 4. The Typographic Mind
- Is there any audience of Americans today who could endure seven hours of talk? or five? or three? Especially without pictures of any kind? ([Location 897](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0023ZLLH6&location=897))
- Whenever language is the principal medium of communication—especially language controlled by the rigors of print—an idea, a fact, a claim is the inevitable result. The idea may be banal, the fact irrelevant, the claim false, but there is no escape from meaning when language is the instrument guiding one’s thought. ([Location 960](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0023ZLLH6&location=960))
- As a consequence a language-centered discourse such as was characteristic of eighteenth- and nineteenth-century America tends to be both content-laden and serious, all the more so when it takes its form from print. ([Location 966](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0023ZLLH6&location=966))
- A written sentence calls upon its author to say something, upon its reader to know the import of what is said. ([Location 968](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0023ZLLH6&location=968))
- The reader must come armed, in a serious state of intellectual readiness. This is not easy because he comes to the text alone. In reading, one’s responses are isolated, one’s intellect thrown back on its own resources. To be confronted by the cold abstractions of printed sentences is to look upon language bare, without the assistance of either beauty or community. ([Location 971](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0023ZLLH6&location=971))
- In a print culture, writers make mistakes when they lie, contradict themselves, fail to support their generalizations, try to enforce illogical connections. In a print culture, readers make mistakes when they don’t notice, or even worse, don’t care. ([Location 985](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0023ZLLH6&location=985))
- If we may take advertising to be the voice of commerce, then its history tells very clearly that in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries those with products to sell took their customers to be not unlike Daniel Webster: they assumed that potential buyers were literate, rational, analytical. ([Location 1093](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0023ZLLH6&location=1093))
- Indeed, the history of newspaper advertising in America may be considered, all by itself, as a metaphor of the descent of the typographic mind, beginning, as it does, with reason, and ending, as it does, with entertainment. ([Location 1095](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0023ZLLH6&location=1095))
- Public figures were known largely by their written words, for example, not by their looks or even their oratory. It is quite likely that most of the first fifteen presidents of the United States would not have been recognized had they passed the average citizen in the street. This would have been the case as well of the great lawyers, ministers and scientists of that era. To think about those men was to think about what they had written, to judge them by their public positions, their arguments, their knowledge as codified in the printed word. You may get some sense of how we are separated from this kind of consciousness by thinking about any of our recent presidents; or even preachers, lawyers and scientists who are or who have recently been public figures. Think of Richard Nixon or Jimmy Carter or Billy Graham, or even Albert Einstein, and what will come to your mind is an image, a picture of a face, most likely a face on a television screen (in Einstein’s case, a photograph of a face). Of words, almost nothing will come to mind. This is the difference between thinking in a word-centered culture and thinking in an image-centered culture. ([Location 1133](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0023ZLLH6&location=1133))
- For two centuries, America declared its intentions, expressed its ideology, designed its laws, sold its products, created its literature and addressed its deities with black squiggles on white paper. ([Location 1169](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0023ZLLH6&location=1169))
- The name I give to that period of time during which the American mind submitted itself to the sovereignty of the printing press is the Age of Exposition. ([Location 1171](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0023ZLLH6&location=1171))
- Almost all of the characteristics we associate with mature discourse were amplified by typography, which has the strongest possible bias toward exposition: a sophisticated ability to think conceptually, deductively and sequentially; a high valuation of reason and order; an abhorrence of contradiction; a large capacity for detachment and objectivity; and a tolerance for delayed response. ([Location 1173](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0023ZLLH6&location=1173))
