## Highlights
- What do AI, self-driving cars, on-demand services, and income inequality have in common? They are telling us, loud and clear, that we’re in for massive changes in work, business, and the economy. ([Location 373](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N34IDU6&location=373))
- We saw that radically new industries don’t start when creative entrepreneurs meet venture capitalists. They start with people who are infatuated with seemingly impossible futures. ([Location 398](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N34IDU6&location=398))
- Can you still remember the first time you realized that you could get the answer to virtually any question with a quick Internet search, or that your phone could route you to any destination? How cool that was, before you started taking it for granted? And how quickly did you move from taking it for granted to complaining about it when it doesn’t work quite right? ([Location 425](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N34IDU6&location=425))
- So what makes a real unicorn of this amazing kind?
  1.  It seems unbelievable at first.
  2.  It changes the way the world works.
  3.  It results in an ecosystem of new services, jobs, business models, and industries. ([Location 432](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N34IDU6&location=432))
- Once you become accustomed to each new superpower, life without it is like having your magic wand turn into a stick again. ([Location 460](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N34IDU6&location=460))
- Technology is going to take our jobs! Yes. It always has, and the pain and dislocation are real. But it is going to make new kinds of jobs possible. History tells us technology kills professions, but does not kill jobs. We will find things to work on that we couldn’t do before but now can accomplish with the help of today’s amazing technologies. ([Location 486](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N34IDU6&location=486))
- This is the true opportunity of technology: It extends human capability. ([Location 502](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N34IDU6&location=502))
- After the fall of Rome, the ability to make monumental structures out of concrete was lost for nearly a thousand years. ([Location 529](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N34IDU6&location=529))
- We are increasingly facing what planners call “wicked problems”—problems that are “difficult or impossible to solve because of incomplete, contradictory, and changing requirements that are often difficult to recognize.” ([Location 531](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N34IDU6&location=531))
- The magical technologies of today—and choices we’ve already made, decades ago, about what we value as a society—are leading us down a path with complex contingencies, unseen dangers, and decisions that we don’t even know we are making. ([Location 540](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N34IDU6&location=540))
- income inequality and the pace of technology change are leading to a populist backlash featuring opposition to science, distrust of our governing institutions, and fear of the future, making it ever more difficult to solve the problems we have created. ([Location 573](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N34IDU6&location=573))
- “The people will rise up before the machines do.” ([Location 588](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N34IDU6&location=588))
- Demographics (in particular, changes in longevity and the birth rate that have radically shifted the mix of ages in the global population), globalization, and urbanization may play at least as large a role as technology. And even that list fails to take into account catastrophic war, plague, or environmental disruption. ([Location 596](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N34IDU6&location=596))
- The future comes in fits and starts, and it is often when times are darkest that the brightest futures are being born. ([Location 626](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N34IDU6&location=626))
- We accepted the idea that what was good for financial markets was good for everyone and structured our economy to drive stock prices ever higher, convincing ourselves that “the market” of stocks, bonds, and derivatives was the same as Adam Smith’s market of real goods and services exchanged by ordinary people. ([Location 632](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N34IDU6&location=632))

### 1 SEEING THE FUTURE IN THE PRESENT
- Edwin Schlossberg: “The skill of writing is to create a context in which other people can think.” ([Location 652](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N34IDU6&location=652))
#### LISTENING FOR THE RHYMES
- It is almost always the case that if you want to see the future, you have to look not at the technologies offered by the mainstream but by the innovators out at the fringes. ([Location 839](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N34IDU6&location=839))
- Treat curiosity and wonder as a guide to the future. ([Location 852](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N34IDU6&location=852))
- he explained that he had gotten so much value from the work of others that he felt an obligation to give something back. ([Location 888](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N34IDU6&location=888))
- The question for me became one of how to maximize value creation for society, rather than simply value capture by an individual or a company. ([Location 899](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N34IDU6&location=899))
- How can a business create more value for society than it captures for itself? ([Location 902](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N34IDU6&location=902))
#### WHAT’S IN A NAME?
- This is a key lesson in how to see the future: bring people together who are already living in it. ([Location 934](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N34IDU6&location=934))
#### ARE YOU LOOKING AT THE MAP OR THE ROAD?
- Language shapes what we are able to see and how we see it. ([Location 950](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N34IDU6&location=950))
- the systematic and increasingly algorithmic selection of news to fit and amplify people’s preconceived views. ([Location 969](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N34IDU6&location=969))
### 2 TOWARD A GLOBAL BRAIN
#### WEB 2.0
#### THE INTERNET AS PLATFORM
#### HARNESSING COLLECTIVE INTELLIGENCE
- Another key to what distinguished the web applications that survived the dot-com bust from those that died was that the survivors all, in one way or another, worked to harness the collective intelligence of their users. ([Location 1145](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N34IDU6&location=1145))
- all gain their power by aggregating the contributions of billions of users. ([Location 1153](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N34IDU6&location=1153))
#### DATA AS THE NEXT INTEL INSIDE
- A lot depends not just on how much data you have, of course, but how able you are to make sense of it. ([Location 1195](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N34IDU6&location=1195))
#### THE END OF THE SOFTWARE RELEASE CYCLE
#### THINKING IN VECTORS
- You must always be alert, though, for an inflection point where the old gives way to something profoundly new. ([Location 1233](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N34IDU6&location=1233))
- The future is the outcome of millions of intersecting vectors, which add up in unexpected ways. The art is to pick out important vectors and weave a net from them in which to catch a view of the future. ([Location 1239](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N34IDU6&location=1239))
#### TWITTER MAKES IT REAL FOR NONPROGRAMMERS
- Today people often think of memes as images and slogans shared on social media, but any great idea that takes hold is a meme. ([Location 1361](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N34IDU6&location=1361))
- But perhaps more important than hostile viruses are those with which we willingly cooperate. ([Location 1372](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N34IDU6&location=1372))
- The kinds of “thoughts” that a global brain has are different from those of an individual, or of a less connected society. At their best, these thoughts allow for coordinated memory on a scale never seen before, and sometimes even for unforeseen ingenuity and new forms of cooperation; at their worst, they allow for the adoption of misinformation as truth, for corrosive attacks on the fabric of society as one portion of the network seeks advantage at the expense of others ([Location 1386](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N34IDU6&location=1386))
- But perhaps the most riveting thing to realize is that, bit by bit, the global brain is getting a body. It has eyes and ears (billions of connected cameras and microphones), a sense of position and motion (GPS and motion sensors) that is far more precise and powerful than that of humans, and with specialized sensors, data-gathering capabilities that far outstrip our own. Now it starts to move. Self-driving cars are a manifestation of the global brain; their memory is the memory of roads traveled under the tutelage of human drivers but recorded with their uncanny senses. But not unsurprisingly, the most powerful manifestation of the global brain’s ability to touch the physical world relies not on robots but on the power of networked applications to direct human activity.

#### A BUSINESS MODEL MAP OF UBER AND LYFT
##### Replacing Ownership with Access.
##### Passengers Who Expect Transportation On Demand.
##### The Magical User Experience
##### Drivers Who Show Up When You Need Them.
##### Augmented Workers.
##### A Platform, Not Just a Company.
##### Management by Algorithm
- the right answer is to develop a social safety net and regulatory frameworks as flexible and responsive as the on-demand business model itself. ([Location 1655](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N34IDU6&location=1655))
- relying on swift consumer adoption to give them allies against regulators. ([Location 1657](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N34IDU6&location=1657))
- They would be wise to get ahead of the problem with regulatory proposals as innovative as their business model. ([Location 1658](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N34IDU6&location=1658))
#### MAKING STRATEGIC CHOICES
- If the goal is truly to make transportation as reliable as running water or electricity, rather than simply to maximize company profit, these companies should deploy self-driving cars not to compete with their drivers but to supplement them, providing services in areas that are currently not well served, even though those cars might be utilized less often. ([Location 1672](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N34IDU6&location=1672))
- More likely, the right answer will be to tune their mathematical models and algorithms to find the optimum mix of human and machine, in the same way that the electrical grid relies on coal, natural gas, or nuclear power for “base load” while meeting peak daytime demand with renewables. ([Location 1675](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N34IDU6&location=1675))
- A business model does not exist in isolation; it must adapt to the competition as well as to the needs of its customers and suppliers.) ([Location 1684](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N34IDU6&location=1684))
#### A BUSINESS MODEL MAP FOR THE NEXT ECONOMY
##### Replacing Materials with Information.
- “Replacing materials with information” is a more powerful formulation than “replacing ownership with access.” ([Location 1733](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N34IDU6&location=1733))
##### Networked Marketplace Platforms.
- Might networks and technology platforms provide a new form of organization that trumps old corporate forms, replacing them with something even more powerful? ([Location 1746](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N34IDU6&location=1746))
##### On Demand.
- On demand is becoming a universal consumer expectation. ([Location 1757](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N34IDU6&location=1757))
- services on demand and talent and resources on demand. On demand affects both sides of the networked marketplace. ([Location 1759](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N34IDU6&location=1759))
##### Managed by Algorithm.
- To have a chance at making a better future for ourselves and our children, we must grasp not only how the nature of these algorithms is changing, but also why the algorithms we have most to fear may not be those of artificial intelligence but the unexamined algorithms that rule our economy. ([Location 1764](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N34IDU6&location=1764))
##### Augmented Workers.
- As we automate something that humans used to do, how can we augment them so that they can do something newly valuable? ([Location 1776](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N34IDU6&location=1776))
- It is also important to understand our role as customers in holding companies accountable for creating the future we want. ([Location 1789](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N34IDU6&location=1789))
- If you want a human-centered future, support companies that demonstrate human-centered values. ([Location 1791](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N34IDU6&location=1791))
##### Magical User Experiences.
### 4 THERE ISN’T JUST ONE FUTURE
- When you draw a new map successfully enough, you change the perception not only of the future but of the past. ([Location 1889](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N34IDU6&location=1889))
#### THINKING THE UNTHINKABLE
- Truly disruptive new services don’t just digitize the familiar. They do away with it. ([Location 1935](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N34IDU6&location=1935))
- When we first proposed running ads on the World Wide Web, I saw ads as a specialized kind of information product, not as the kind of intrusive media bombardment they became. ([Location 1972](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N34IDU6&location=1972))
- This is a key lesson for every entrepreneur. Ask yourself: What is unthinkable? ([Location 2022](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N34IDU6&location=2022))
#### MAGICAL USER EXPERIENCE: SEEING THE PRESENT WITH FRESH EYES
- Real breakthroughs come when an entrepreneur doesn’t just use new technology to duplicate what went before or to fine-tune the way the world works now, but to reimagine how it ought to work. ([Location 2071](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N34IDU6&location=2071))
### 5 NETWORKS AND THE NATURE OF THE FIRM
#### THE EVOLUTION OF PLATFORMS
- Clay Shirky described the move from “filter, then publish” to “publish, then filter” as one of the key advantages brought by the Internet to publishing, but the lesson applies to almost every Internet marketplace. ([Location 2125](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N34IDU6&location=2125))
