## Highlights
- Second, because of its lengthy, intimate, and inevitable relationship with culture, technology does not invite a close examination of its own consequences. It is the kind of friend that asks for trust and obedience, which most people are inclined to give because its gifts are truly bountiful. But, of course, there is a dark side to this friend. Its gifts are not without a heavy cost. Stated in the most dramatic terms, the accusation can be made that the uncontrolled growth of technology destroys the vital sources of our humanity. It creates a culture without a moral foundation. It undermines certain mental processes and social relations that make human life worth living. Technology, in sum, is both friend and enemy.

- American success may serve as a confirmation of the catastrophic idea that in peace as well as war technology will be our savior. ([Location 64](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=64))
### 1 The Judgment Of Thamus
- “Theuth, my paragon of inventors, the discoverer of an art is not the best judge of the good or harm which will accrue to those who practice it. ([Location 75](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=75))
- We may learn from this that it is a mistake to suppose that any technological innovation has a one-sided effect. Every technology is both a burden and a blessing; not either-or, but this-and-that. ([Location 87](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=87))
- we are currently surrounded by throngs of zealous Theuths, one-eyed prophets who see only what new technologies can do and are incapable of imagining what they will undo. We might call such people Technophiles. ... On the other hand, some one-eyed prophets, such as I (or so I am accused), are inclined to speak only of burdens (in the manner of Thamus) and are silent about the opportunities that new technologies make possible. ([Location 90](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=90))
- If one is to err, it is better to err on the side of Thamusian skepticism. But it is an error nonetheless. ([Location 95](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=95))
- For it is inescapable that every culture must negotiate with technology, whether it does so intelligently or not. A bargain is struck in which technology giveth and technology taketh away. ([Location 98](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=98))
- In tabulating the cost of technological progress, Freud takes a rather depressing line, that of a man who agrees with Thoreau’s remark that our inventions are but improved means to an unimproved end. ([Location 114](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=114))
- He would allow, I imagine, that a technology may be barred entry to a culture. But we may learn from Thamus the following: once a technology is admitted, it plays out its hand; it does what it is designed to do. Our task is to understand what that design is—that is to say, when we admit a new technology to the culture, we must do so with our eyes wide open. ([Location 127](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=127))
- it is a certainty that radical technologies create new definitions of old terms, and that this process takes place without our being fully conscious of it. ([Location 133](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=133))
- New things require new words. But new things also modify old words, words that have deep-rooted meanings. ([Location 137](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=137))
- The old words still look the same, are still used in the same kinds of sentences. But they do not have the same meanings; in some cases, they have opposite meanings. ([Location 142](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=142))
- technology imperiously commandeers our most important terminology. It redefines “freedom,” “truth,” “intelligence,” “fact,” “wisdom,” “memory,” “history”—all the words we live by. And it does not pause to tell us. And we do not pause to ask. ([Location 143](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=143))
- Harold Innis, the father of modern communication studies, repeatedly spoke of the “knowledge monopolies” created by important technologies. ... those who have control over the workings of a particular technology accumulate power and inevitably form a kind of conspiracy against those who have no access to the specialized knowledge made available by the technology. ([Location 149](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=149))
- the benefits and deficits of a new technology are not distributed equally. There are, as it were, winners and losers. It is both puzzling and poignant that on many occasions the losers, out of ignorance, have actually cheered the winners, and some still do. ([Location 154](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=154))
    - Note: Is this like the American Dream thing, where as long as people think “I have a chance to be that”, they will cheer for it? Because they have a speck of hope?
- On the other hand and in the long run, television may bring a gradual end to the careers of schoolteachers, since school was an invention of the printing press and must stand or fall on the issue of how much importance the printed word has. ([Location 159](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=159))
- What could they have done? ([Location 165](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=165))
    - Note: They could have gotten involved in the next evolution, right? Of working on automotive.
- almost nothing that they need happens to the losers. Which is why they are losers. ([Location 174](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=174))
- But discreetly they neglect to say from whose point of view the efficiency is warranted or what might be its costs. ([Location 177](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=177))
- to whom will the technology give greater power and freedom? And whose power and freedom will be reduced by it? ([Location 181](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=181))
    - Tags: [[favorite]] 
- in cultures that have a democratic ethos, relatively weak traditions, and a high receptivity to new technologies, everyone is inclined to be enthusiastic about technological change, believing that its benefits will eventually spread evenly among the entire population. ([Location 184](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=184))
- He meant that new technologies change what we mean by “knowing” and “truth”; they alter those deeply embedded habits of thought which give to a culture its sense of what the world is like—a sense of what is the natural order of things, of what is reasonable, of what is necessary, of what is inevitable, of what is real. ([Location 194](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=194))
- embedded in every tool is an ideological bias, a predisposition to construct the world as one thing rather than another, to value one thing over another, to amplify one sense or skill or attitude more loudly than another. ([Location 214](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=214))
- Unforeseen consequences stand in the way of all those who think they see clearly the direction in which a new technology will take us. ([Location 234](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=234))
- Orality stresses group learning, cooperation, and a sense of social responsibility, ([Location 267](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=267))
- Print stresses individualized learning, competition, and personal autonomy. ([Location 268](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=268))
- Technological change is neither additive nor subtractive. It is ecological. I mean “ecological” in the same sense as the word is used by environmental scientists. One significant change generates total change. ([Location 275](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=275))
- Surrounding every technology are institutions whose organization—not to mention their reason for being—reflects the world-view promoted by the technology. ([Location 282](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=282))
    - Note: So is there any way to try to predict the “ecological” changes or worldview of technology?
- New technologies alter the structure of our interests: the things we think about. They alter the character of our symbols: the things we think with. And they alter the nature of community: the arena in which thoughts develop. ([Location 301](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=301))
### 2 From Tools to Technocracy
- Cultures may be classified into three types: tool-using cultures, technocracies, and technopolies. ([Location 326](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=326))
- the main characteristic of all tool-using cultures is that their tools were largely invented to do two things: to solve specific and urgent problems of physical life, such as in the use of waterpower, windmills, and the heavy-wheeled plow; or to serve the symbolic world of art, politics, myth, ritual, and religion, as in the construction of castles and cathedrals and the development of the mechanical clock. ([Location 331](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=331))
- Tool-using cultures, then, may have many tools or few, may be enthusiastic about tools or contemptuous. The name “tool-using culture” derives from the relationship in a given culture between tools and the belief system or ideology. The tools are not intruders. They are integrated into the culture in ways that do not pose significant contradictions to its world-view. ([Location 366](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=366))
- We may say, further, that all tool-using cultures—from the technologically most primitive to the most sophisticated—are theocratic or, if not that, unified by some metaphysical theory. Such a theology or metaphysics provides order and meaning to existence, making it almost impossible for technics to subordinate people to its own needs. ([Location 375](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=375))
- In a technocracy, tools play a central role in the thought-world of the culture. Everything must give way, in some degree, to their development. The social and symbolic worlds become increasingly subject to the requirements of that development. Tools are not integrated into the culture; they attack the culture. They bid to become the culture. As a consequence, tradition, social mores, myth, politics, ritual, and religion have to fight for their lives. ([Location 411](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=411))
- We have here a clear call for a separation of moral and intellectual values, a separation that is one of the pillars of a technocracy—a significant step but still a small one. ([Location 456](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=456))
- Whereas men had traditionally looked to Heaven to find authority, purpose, and meaning, the Sleepwalkers (as Arthur Koestler called Copernicus, Kepler, and Galileo) looked not to Heaven but to the heavens. There they found only mathematical equations and geometric patterns. They did so with courage but not without misgivings, for they did their best to keep their faith, and they did not turn away from God. They believed in a God who had planned and designed the whole of creation, a God who was a master mathematician. Their search for the mathematical laws of nature was, fundamentally, a religious quest. ([Location 494](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=494))
- Moreover, the science they created was almost wholly concerned with questions of truth, not power. ([Location 505](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=505))
- These were men who thought of philosophy (which is what they called science) as the Greeks did, believing that the true object of investigating nature is speculative satisfaction. They were not concerned with the idea of progress, and did not believe that their speculations held the promise of any important improvements in the conditions of life. ([Location 508](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=508))
- He brought science down from the heavens, including mathematics, which he conceived of as a humble handmaiden to invention. In this utilitarian view of knowledge, Bacon was the chief architect of a new edifice of thought in which resignation was cast out and God assigned to a special room. The name of the building was Progress and Power. ([Location 516](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=516))
- It is in this work that he denounces the infamous four Idols, which have kept man from gaining power over nature: Idols of the Tribe, which lead us to believe our perceptions are the same as nature’s facts; Idols of the Cave, which lead us to mistaken ideas derived from heredity and environment; Idols of the Market-place, which lead us to be deluded by words; and Idols of the Theater, which lead us to the misleading dogmas of the philosophers. ([Location 539](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=539))
- people came to believe that knowledge is power, that humanity is capable of progressing, that poverty is a great evil, and that the life of the average person is as meaningful as any other. ([Location 552](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=552))
### 3 From Technocracy to Technopoly
- ...technocracy—that is, a society only loosely controlled by social custom and religious tradition and driven by the impulse to invent ([Location 575](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=575))
    - Tags: [[definition]] 
- We had learned how to invent things, and the question of why we invent things receded in importance. The idea that if something could be done it should be done was born in the nineteenth century. And along with it, there developed a profound belief in all the principles through which invention succeeds: objectivity, efficiency, expertise, standardization, measurement, and progress. It also came to be believed that the engine of technological progress worked most efficiently when people are conceived of not as children of God or even as citizens but as consumers—that is to say, as markets. ([Location 596](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=596))
    - Tags: [[favorite]] 
- The nineteenth century also saw the emergence of “utopian” communities, ([Location 604](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=604))
- ...the term “Luddite” has come to mean an almost childish and certainly naïve opposition to technology. But the historical Luddites were neither childish nor naïve. They were people trying desperately to preserve whatever rights, privileges, laws, and customs had given them justice in the older world-view... ([Location 613](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=613))
- And though it is true that technocratic capitalism created slums and alienation, it is also true that such conditions were perceived as an evil that could and should be eradicated; that is to say, technocracies brought into being an increased respect for the average person, whose potential and even convenience became a matter of compelling political interest and urgent social policy. ([Location 621](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=621))
- the revolutionary nature of the new means of production and communication would have naturally generated radical ideas in every realm of human enterprise. Technocracy gave us the idea of progress, and of necessity loosened our bonds with tradition—whether political or spiritual. Technocracy filled the air with the promise of new freedoms and new forms of social organization. Technocracy also speeded up the world. We could get places faster, do things faster, accomplish more in a shorter time. Time, in fact, became an adversary over which technology could triumph. And this meant that there was no time to look back or to contemplate what was being lost. ([Location 635](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=635))
- Technocracy did not entirely destroy the traditions of the social and symbolic worlds. Technocracy subordinated these worlds—yes, even humiliated them—but it did not render them totally ineffectual. ([Location 644](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=644))
- Twain liked nothing better than to describe the giantism and ingenuity of American industry. But at the same time, the totality of his work is an affirmation of preindustrial values. Personal loyalty, regional tradition, the continuity of family life, the relevance of the tales and wisdom of the elderly are the soul of his work throughout. ([Location 662](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=662))
- The citizens of a technocracy knew that science and technology did not provide philosophies by which to live, and they clung to the philosophies of their fathers. ([Location 671](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=671))
- Nor could they quite believe, as the new cosmology taught, that the universe is the outcome of accidental collocations of atoms. And they continued to believe, as Mark Twain did, that, for all their dependence on machinery, tools ought still to be their servants, not their masters. They would allow their tools to be presumptuous, aggressive, audacious, impudent servants, but that tools should rise above their servile station was an appalling thought. And though technocracy found no clear place for the human soul, its citizens held to the belief that no increase in material wealth would compensate them for a culture that insulted their self-respect. And so two opposing world-views—the technological and the traditional—coexisted in uneasy tension. The technological was the stronger, of course, but the traditional was there—still functional, still exerting influence, still too much alive to ignore. ([Location 673](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=673))
- Technopoly eliminates alternatives to itself in precisely the way Aldous Huxley outlined in Brave New World. It does not make them illegal. It does not make them immoral. It does not even make them unpopular. It makes them invisible and therefore irrelevant. And it does so by redefining what we mean by religion, by art, by family, by politics, by history, by truth, by privacy, by intelligence, so that our definitions fit its new requirements. Technopoly, in other words, is totalitarian technocracy. ([Location 683](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=683))
- I use this event as a fitting starting point because Taylor’s book The Principles of Scientific Management, published in 1911, contains the first explicit and formal outline of the assumptions of the thought-world of Technopoly. These include the beliefs that the primary, if not the only, goal of human labor and thought is efficiency; that technical calculation is in all respects superior to human judgment; that in fact human judgment cannot be trusted, because it is plagued by laxity, ambiguity, and unnecessary complexity; that subjectivity is an obstacle to clear thinking; that what cannot be measured either does not exist or is of no value; and that the affairs of citizens are best guided and conducted by experts. ([Location 721](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=721))
- workers were relieved of any responsibility to think at all. The system would do their thinking for them. That is crucial, because it led to the idea that technique of any kind can do our thinking for us, which is among the basic principles of Technopoly. ([Location 731](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=731))
- Technocracies are concerned to invent machinery. That people’s lives are changed by machinery is taken as a matter of course, and that people must sometimes be treated as if they were machinery is considered a necessary and unfortunate condition of technological development. But in technocracies, such a condition is not held to be a philosophy of culture. Technocracy does not have as its aim a grand reductionism in which human life must find its meaning in machinery and technique. Technopoly does. ([Location 738](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=738))
- Technopoly—the submission of all forms of cultural life to the sovereignty of technique and technology ([Location 744](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=744))
- Consequently, in his mind the idea of newness is closely linked with that of improvement. ([Location 749](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=749))
- It is enough to say here that the American distrust of constraints—one might even say the American skepticism toward culture itself—offered encouragement to radical and thoughtless technological intrusions. ([Location 754](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=754))
- Robber Barons. What they were robbing—it is clearer now than it was then—was America’s past, for their essential idea was that nothing is so much worth preserving that it should stand in the way of technological innovation. ([Location 759](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=759))
- the success of twentieth-century technology in providing Americans with convenience, comfort, speed, hygiene, and abundance was so obvious and promising that there seemed no reason to look for any other sources of fulfillment or creativity or purpose. ([Location 763](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=763))
- To prayer, the alternative is penicillin; to family roots, the alternative is mobility; to reading, the alternative is television; to restraint, the alternative is immediate gratification; to sin, the alternative is psychotherapy; to political ideology, the alternative is popular appeal established through scientific polling. ([Location 765](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=765))
    - Note: These aren’t direct comparisons
### 4 The Improbable World
- Another possible conclusion was expressed by George Bernard Shaw, also about fifty years ago, when he wrote that the average person today is about as credulous as was the average person in the Middle Ages. In the Middle Ages, people believed in the authority of their religion, no matter what. Today, we believe in the authority of our science, no matter what. ([Location 806](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=806))
- the world we live in is very nearly incomprehensible to most of us. There is almost no fact, whether actual or imagined, that will surprise us for very long, since we have no comprehensive and consistent picture of the world that would make the fact appear as an unacceptable contradiction. We believe because there is no reason not to believe. ([Location 810](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=810))
- Abetted by a form of education that in itself has been emptied of any coherent world-view, Technopoly deprives us of the social, political, historical, metaphysical, logical, or spiritual bases for knowing what is beyond belief. ([Location 813](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=813))
- Having no expectation of a pattern, no basis for assuming a given order, you have no reason to react with incredulity or even surprise to whatever card turns up. ([Location 825](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=825))
- The belief system of a tool-using culture is rather like a brand-new deck of cards. Whether it is a culture of technological simplicity or sophistication, there always exists a more or less comprehensive, ordered world-view, resting on a set of metaphysical or theological assumptions. Ordinary men and women might not clearly grasp how the harsh realities of their lives fit into the grand and benevolent design of the universe, but they have no doubt that there is such a design, and their priests and shamans are well able, by deduction from a handful of principles, to make it, if not wholly rational, at least coherent. ([Location 826](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=826))
- with the emergence of technocracies moral and intellectual coherence began to unravel. ([Location 834](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=834))
- The faith of those who believed in Progress was based on the assumption that one could discern a purpose to the human enterprise, even without the theological scaffolding that supported the Christian edifice of belief. Science and technology were the chief instruments of Progress, and in their accumulation of reliable information about nature they would bring ignorance, superstition, and suffering to an end. ([Location 837](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=837))
- But the genie that came out of the bottle proclaiming that information was the new god of culture was a deceiver. It solved the problem of information scarcity, the disadvantages of which were obvious. But it gave no warning about the dangers of information glut, the disadvantages of which were not seen so clearly. ([Location 842](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=842))
- The fact is, there are very few political, social, and especially personal problems that arise because of insufficient information. Nonetheless, as incomprehensible problems mount, as the concept of progress fades, as meaning itself becomes suspect, the Technopolist stands firm in believing that what the world needs is yet more information. ([Location 850](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=850))
- This is the elevation of information to a metaphysical status: information as both the means and end of human creativity. In Technopoly, we are driven to fill our lives with the quest to “access” information. For what purpose or with what limitations, it is not for us to ask; and we are not accustomed to asking, since the problem is unprecedented. ([Location 856](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=856))
    - Note: Wisdom becomes more important that knowledge.
- innovations in the format of the machine-made book were an attempt to control the flow of information, to organize it by establishing priorities and by giving it sequence. ([Location 874](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=874))
- Schools became technocracy’s first secular bureaucracies, structures for legitimizing some parts of the flow of information and discrediting other parts. Schools were, in short, a means of governing the ecology of information. ([Location 880](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=880))
    - Note: What has taken this place, now? Google? Social media? YouTube?
- Indeed, one way of defining a Technopoly is to say that its information immune system is inoperable. Technopoly is a form of cultural AIDS, which I here use as an acronym for Anti-Information Deficiency Syndrome. This is why it is possible to say almost anything without contradiction provided you begin your utterance with the words “A study has shown …” or “Scientists now tell us that …” More important, it is why in a Technopoly there can be no transcendent sense of purpose or meaning, no cultural coherence. Information is dangerous when it has no place to go, when there is no theory to which it applies, no pattern in which it fits, when there is no higher purpose that it serves. ([Location 887](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=887))
    - Note: We probably have an unspoken pattern, what is it?
- America was the first nation ever to be argued into existence in print. ([Location 927](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=927))
- There is not a single line written by Jefferson, Adams, Paine, Hamilton, or Franklin that does not take for granted that when information is made available to citizens they are capable of managing it. This is not to say that the Founding Fathers believed information could not be false, misleading, or irrelevant. But they believed that the marketplace of information and ideas was sufficiently ordered so that citizens could make sense of what they read and heard and, through reason, judge its usefulness to their lives. ([Location 937](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=937))
    - Note: Was that true then? Is it still?
- But more than this, telegraphy created the idea of context-free information—that is, the idea that the value of information need not be tied to any function it might serve in social and political decision-making and action. The telegraph made information into a commodity, a “thing” that could be bought and sold irrespective of its uses or meaning.2 ([Location 949](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=949))
- With telegraphy and photography leading the way, a new definition of information came into being. Here was information that rejected the necessity of interconnectedness, proceeded without context, argued for instancy against historical continuity, and offered fascination in place of complexity and coherence. ([Location 966](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=966))
- Information has become a form of garbage, not only incapable of answering the most fundamental human questions but barely useful in providing coherent direction to the solution of even mundane problems. To say it still another way: The milieu in which Technopoly flourishes is one in which the tie between information and human purpose has been severed, i.e., information appears indiscriminately, directed at no one in particular, in enormous volume and at high speeds, and disconnected from theory, meaning, or purpose. ([Location 978](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=978))
- I have referred to it elsewhere as a peek-a-boo world, where now this event, now that, pops into view for a moment, then vanishes again. ([Location 982](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=982))
- It is a world in which the idea of human progress, as Bacon expressed it, has been replaced by the idea of technological progress. ([Location 983](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=983))
- We are a culture consuming itself with information, and many of us do not even wonder how to control the process. We proceed under the assumption that information is our friend, believing that cultures may suffer grievously from a lack of information, which, of course, they do. It is only now beginning to be understood that cultures may also suffer grievously from information glut, information without meaning, information without control mechanisms.

### 5 The Broken Defenses
- Technopoly is a state of culture. It is also a state of mind. It consists in the deification of technology, which means that the culture seeks its authorization in technology, finds its satisfactions in technology, and takes its orders from technology. ([Location 991](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=991))
- Those who feel most comfortable in Technopoly are those who are convinced that technical progress is humanity’s supreme achievement and the instrument by which our most profound dilemmas may be solved. They also believe that information is an unmixed blessing, which through its continued and uncontrolled production and dissemination offers increased freedom, creativity, and peace of mind. ([Location 994](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=994))
- Technology increases the available supply of information. As the supply is increased, control mechanisms are strained. Additional control mechanisms are needed to cope with new information. When additional control mechanisms are themselves technical, they in turn further increase the supply of information. When the supply of information is no longer controllable, a general breakdown in psychic tranquillity and social purpose occurs. Without defenses, people have no way of finding meaning in their experiences, lose their capacity to remember, and have difficulty imagining reasonable futures. ([Location 999](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=999))
- One way of defining Technopoly, then, is to say it is what happens to society when the defenses against information glut have broken down. It is what happens when institutional life becomes inadequate to cope with too much information. It is what happens when a culture, overcome by information generated by technology, tries to employ technology itself as a means of providing clear direction and humane purpose. ([Location 1003](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=1003))
- All societies have institutions and techniques that function as does a biological immune system. Their purpose is to maintain a balance between the old and the new, between novelty and tradition, between meaning and conceptual disorder, and they do so by “destroying” unwanted information. ([Location 1012](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=1012))
- Social institutions sometimes do their work simply by denying people access to information, but principally by directing how much weight and, therefore, value one must give to information. Social institutions are concerned with the meaning of information and can be quite rigorous in enforcing standards of admission. ([Location 1018](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=1018))
- As other institutions become unusable as mechanisms for the control of wanton information, the courts stand as a final arbiter of truth. For how long, no one knows. ([Location 1032](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=1032))
- The point to be stressed here is that any educational institution, if it is to function well in the management of information, must have a theory about its purpose and meaning, must have the means to give clear expression to its theory, and must do so, to a large extent, by excluding information. ([Location 1049](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=1049))
- Courts of law, the school, and the family are only three of several control institutions that serve as part of a culture’s information immune system. The political party is another. ([Location 1064](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=1064))
- all theories are oversimplifications, or at least lead to oversimplification. The rule of law is an oversimplification. A curriculum is an oversimplification. So is a family’s conception of a child. That is the function of theories—to oversimplify, and thus to assist believers in organizing, weighting, and excluding information. Therein lies the power of theories. Their weakness is that precisely because they oversimplify, they are vulnerable to attack by new information. When there is too much information to sustain any theory, information becomes essentially meaningless. ([Location 1076](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=1076))
- The most imposing institutions for the control of information are religion and the state. They do their work in a somewhat more abstract way than do courts, schools, families, or political parties. They manage information through the creation of myths and stories that express theories about fundamental questions: why are we here, where have we come from, and where are we headed? ([Location 1080](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=1080))
- This is still another way of defining Technopoly. The term is aptly used for a culture whose available theories do not offer guidance about what is acceptable information in the moral domain. ([Location 1111](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=1111))
    - Note: It seemed like at least the Technocracy level that “Progress” and reduction of suffering etc. was the moral reasoning, right?
- that it is not enough for his nation to liberate itself from one flawed theory; it is necessary to find another, and he worries that Technopoly provides no answer. ([Location 1153](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=1153))
- Technopoly, a twentieth-century thought-world that functions not only without a transcendent narrative to provide moral underpinnings but also without strong social institutions to control the flood of information produced by technology. ([Location 1156](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=1156))
- Because that flood has laid waste the theories on which schools, families, political parties, religion, nationhood itself are based, American Technopoly must rely, to an obsessive extent, on technical methods to control the flow of information. ([Location 1158](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=1158))
    - Tags: [[c1]] 
- a bureaucracy is simply a coordinated series of techniques for reducing the amount of information that requires processing. ([Location 1179](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=1179))
- the invention of the standardized form—a staple of bureaucracy—allows for the “destruction” of every nuance and detail of a situation. ([Location 1181](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=1181))
- Bureaucracy is, as Max Weber described it, an attempt to rationalize the flow of information, to make its use efficient to the highest degree by eliminating information that diverts attention from the problem at hand. ([Location 1183](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=1183))
- bureaucracy has no intellectual, political, or moral theory—except for its implicit assumption that efficiency is the principal aim of all social institutions and that other goals are essentially less worthy, if not irrelevant. ([Location 1194](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=1194))
- “bureaucracy effect”: as techniques for managing information became more necessary, extensive, and complex, the number of people and structures required to manage those techniques grew, and so did the amount of information generated by bureaucratic techniques. This created the need for bureaucracies to manage and coordinate bureaucracies, then for additional structures and techniques to manage the bureaucracies that coordinated bureaucracies, and so on—until bureaucracy became, to borrow again Karl Kraus’s comment on psychoanalysis, the disease for which it purported to be the cure. Along the way, it ceased to be merely a servant of social institutions and became their master. Bureaucracy now not only solves problems but creates them. More important, it defines what our problems are—and they are always, in the bureaucratic view, problems of efficiency. ([Location 1200](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=1200))
- The bureaucrat considers the implications of a decision only to the extent that the decision will affect the efficient operations of the bureaucracy, and takes no responsibility for its human consequences. ([Location 1214](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=1214))
- Technopoly’s experts claim dominion not only over technical matters but also over social, psychological, and moral affairs. ([Location 1227](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=1227))
- There is no aspect of human relations that has not been technicalized and therefore relegated to the control of experts. ([Location 1229](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=1229))
- These special characteristics of the expert arose as a result of three factors. First, the growth of bureaucracies, which, in effect, produced the world’s first entirely mechanistic specialists and thereby gave credence and prestige to the specialist-as-ignoramus. Second, the weakening of traditional social institutions, which led ordinary people to lose confidence in the value of tradition. Third, and underlying everything else, the torrent of information which made it impossible for anyone to possess more than a tiny fraction of the sum total of human knowledge. ([Location 1230](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=1230))
- The role of the expert is to concentrate on one field of knowledge, sift through all that is available, eliminate that which has no bearing on a problem, and use what is left to assist in solving a problem. This process works fairly well in situations where only a technical solution is required and there is no conflict with human purposes—for example, in space rocketry or the construction of a sewer system. It works less well in situations where technical requirements may conflict with human purposes, as in medicine or architecture. And it is disastrous when applied to situations that cannot be solved by technical means and where efficiency is usually irrelevant, such as in education, law, family life, and problems of personal maladjustment. ([Location 1237](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=1237))
    - Note: even those examples have conflict with human purposes...such as environmental impacts
- the expert relies on our believing in the reality of technical machinery, which means we will reify the answers generated by the machinery. ([Location 1255](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=1255))
- unless such decisions are made with profound skepticism—that is, acknowledged as being made for administrative convenience—they are delusionary. ([Location 1264](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=1264))
- The god they serve does not speak of righteousness or goodness or mercy or grace. Their god speaks of efficiency, precision, objectivity. And that is why such concepts as sin and evil disappear in Technopoly. ([Location 1268](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=1268))
- As the power of traditional social institutions to organize perceptions and judgment declines, bureaucracies, expertise, and technical machinery become the principal means by which Technopoly hopes to control information and thereby provide itself with intelligibility and order. ([Location 1272](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=1272))
### 6 The Ideology of Machines: Medical Technology
- When it comes to machinery, what Technopoly insists upon most is accuracy. The idea embedded in the machine is largely ignored, no matter how peculiar. ([Location 1292](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=1292))
- What is significant about magic is that it directs our attention to the wrong place. And by doing so, evokes in us a sense of wonder rather than understanding. In Technopoly, we are surrounded by the wondrous effects of machines and are encouraged to ignore the ideas embedded in them. Which means we become blind to the ideological meaning of our technologies. ([Location 1304](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=1304))
- What all this means is that even restrained and selective technological medicine becomes very difficult to do, economically undesirable, and possibly professionally catastrophic. The culture itself—its courts, its bureaucracies, its insurance system, the training of doctors, patients’ expectations—is organized to support technological treatments. ([Location 1422](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=1422))
    - Note: E.g. the idea that we prescribe and do surgery but focus less on overall health and prevention and systemic issues.
- In other words, iatrogenics (treatment-induced illness) is now a major concern for the profession, and an even greater concern for the patient. ([Location 1459](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=1459))
- What conclusions may we draw? First, technology is not a neutral element in the practice of medicine: doctors do not merely use technologies but are used by them. Second, technology creates its own imperatives and, at the same time, creates a wide-ranging social system to reinforce its imperatives. And third, technology changes the practice of medicine by redefining what doctors are, redirecting where they focus their attention, and reconceptualizing how they view their patients and illness. ([Location 1469](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=1469))
- Through it all, the question of what was being undone had a low priority if it was asked at all. The Zeitgeist of the age placed such a question in a range somewhere between peevishness and irrelevance. In a growing Technopoly, there is no time or inclination to speak of technological debits. ([Location 1476](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=1476))
### 7 The Ideology of Machines: Computer Technology
- the computer redefines humans as “information processors” and nature itself as information to be processed. The fundamental metaphorical message of the computer, in short, is that we are machines—thinking machines, to be sure, but machines nonetheless. It is for this reason that the computer is the quintessential, incomparable, near-perfect machine for Technopoly. It subordinates the claims of our nature, our biology, our emotions, our spirituality. The computer claims sovereignty over the whole range of human experience, and supports its claim by showing that it “thinks” better than we can. ([Location 1539](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=1539))
- McCarthy claims that “even machines as simple as thermostats can be said to have beliefs.” ([Location 1546](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=1546))
    - Note: This is at the heart of how we need to analyze. What is the technology’s assumptions, purpose, limitations, enforcements, etc.? (This is not how it’s used in the next phrases, but important nevertheless.)
- From the proposition that humans are in some respects like machines, we move to the proposition that humans are little else but machines and, finally, that human beings are machines. And then, inevitably, as McCarthy’s remark suggests, to the proposition that machines are human beings. It follows that machines can be made that duplicate human intelligence, and thus research in the field known as artificial intelligence was inevitable. What is most significant about this line of thinking is the dangerous reductionism it represents. ([Location 1553](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=1553))
- artificial intelligence does not and cannot lead to a meaning-making, understanding, and feeling creature, which is what a human being is. ([Location 1566](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=1566))
    - Note: How do we prove if this is true or not?
- We may call this line of thinking an “agentic shift,” a term I borrow from Stanley Milgram to name the process whereby humans transfer responsibility for an outcome from themselves to a more abstract agent. When this happens, we have relinquished control, which in the case of the computer means that we may, without excessive remorse, pursue ill-advised or even inhuman goals because the computer can accomplish them or be imagined to accomplish them. ([Location 1586](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=1586))
    - Tags: [[definition]] 
- “The computer shows …” or “The computer has determined …” It is Technopoly’s equivalent of the sentence “It is God’s will,” and the effect is roughly the same. ([Location 1602](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=1602))
- their decisions are made on the basis of solutions generated by computers, and this is usually good enough to put our minds at ease or, rather, to sleep. In any case, it constrains us from making complaints or accusations. In part for this reason, the computer has strengthened bureaucratic institutions and suppressed the impulse toward significant social change. ([Location 1610](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=1610))
    - Note: This is where the algorithm/decision method should be visible. You should be able to interrogate how the conclusion was reached. (Weapons of Math Destruction)
- since a human being is in fact not a machine but a biological organism all of whose organs are interrelated and profoundly affected by mental states, the human-as-machine metaphor has serious medical limitations and can have devastating effects. ([Location 1634](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=1634))
- Modern industrial techniques are made possible by the idea that a machine is made up of isolatable and interchangeable parts. But in organizing factories so that workers are also conceived of as isolatable and interchangeable parts, industry has engendered deep alienation and bitterness. ([Location 1636](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=1636))
- We have devalued the singular human capacity to see things whole in all their psychic, emotional and moral dimensions, and we have replaced this with faith in the powers of technical calculation. ([Location 1642](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=1642))
- “technological modesty”—that is, having a sense of the whole and not claiming or obtruding more than a particular function warrants. ([Location 1665](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=1665))
- Technological immodesty is always an acute danger in Technopoly, which encourages it. Technopoly also encourages in-sensitivity to what skills may be lost in the acquisition of new ones. ([Location 1678](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=1678))
- As he notes, “a system of precedent is unnecessary when there are very few accessible cases, and unworkable when there are too many.” ([Location 1695](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=1695))
### 8 Invisible Technologies
- If we define ideology as a set of assumptions of which we are barely conscious but which nonetheless directs our efforts to give shape and coherence to the world, then our most powerful ideological instrument is the technology of language itself. ([Location 1702](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=1702))
- Of course, most of us, most of the time, are unaware of how language does its work. We live deep within the boundaries of our linguistic assumptions and have little sense of how the world looks to those who speak a vastly different tongue. ([Location 1709](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=1709))
- it is easier to see how a machine re-creates the world in its own image. But in many respects, a sentence functions very much like a machine, ([Location 1725](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=1725))
- The form of a question may even block us from seeing solutions to problems that become visible through a different question. ([Location 1742](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=1742))
- Questions, then, are like computers or television or stethoscopes or lie detectors, in that they are mechanisms that give direction to our thoughts, generate new ideas, venerate old ones, expose facts, or hide them. ([Location 1755](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=1755))
- The first problem is called reification, which means converting an abstract idea (mostly, a word) into a thing. ([Location 1804](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=1804))
    - Tags: [[definition]] 
- The second problem is ranking. Ranking requires a criterion for assigning individuals to their place in a single series. ([Location 1808](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=1808))
- Lacking a lucid set of ethics and having rejected tradition, Technopoly searches for a source of authority and finds it in the idea of statistical objectivity. ([Location 1828](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=1828))
- The only plausible answer to the question why we use statistics for such measurements is that it is done for sociopolitical reasons whose essential malignancy is disguised by the cover of “scientific inquiry.” ([Location 1837](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=1837))
- It is not unreasonable to argue that the polling of public opinion puts democracy on a sound and scientific footing. If our political leaders are supposed to represent us, they must have some information about what we “believe.” In principle, there is no problem here. The problems lie elsewhere, and there are at least four of them. ([Location 1853](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=1853))
- The first has to do with the forms of the questions that are put to the public. ([Location 1856](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=1856))
- The public’s “opinion” on almost any issue will be a function of the question asked. ([Location 1859](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=1859))
- In the American Technopoly, public opinion is a yes or no answer to an unexamined question. ([Location 1866](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=1866))
- Second, the technique of polling promotes the assumption that an opinion is a thing inside people that can be exactly located and extracted by the pollster’s questions. ([Location 1867](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=1867))
- we might better say that people do not exactly “have” opinions but are, rather, involved in “opinioning.” That an opinion is conceived of as a measurable thing falsifies the process by which people, in fact, do their opinioning; and how people do their opinioning goes to the heart of the meaning of a democratic society. ([Location 1871](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=1871))
- third point. Generally, polling ignores what people know about the subjects they are queried on. ([Location 1874](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=1874))
- that statistics creates an enormous amount of completely useless information, which compounds the always difficult task of locating that which is useful to a culture. This is more than a case of “information-overload.” It is a matter of “information-trivia,” which has the effect of placing all information on an equal level. ([Location 1900](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=1900))
- But statistics, like any other technology, has a tendency to run out of control, to occupy more of our mental space than it warrants, to invade realms of discourse where it can only wreak havoc. ([Location 1920](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=1920))
- Management is a system of power and control designed to make maximum use of relevant knowledge, the hierarchical organization of human abilities, and the flow of information from bottom to top and back again. ([Location 1933](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=1933))
- modern business did not invent management; management invented modern business. ([Location 1937](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=1937))
- We may call any such system of procedures and rules a technique; and there is nothing to fear from techniques, unless, like so much of our machinery, they become autonomous. ([Location 1975](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=1975))
- The argument is with the triumph of technique, with techniques that become sanctified and rule out the possibilities of other ones. ([Location 1983](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=1983))
### 9 Scientism
- By Scientism, I mean three interrelated ideas that, taken together, stand as one of the pillars of Technopoly. ... The first and indispensable idea is, as noted, that the methods of the natural sciences can be applied to the study of human behavior. ... The second idea is, as also noted, that social science generates specific principles which can be used to organize society on a rational and humane basis. ... The third idea is that faith in science can serve as a comprehensive belief system that gives meaning to life, as well as a sense of well-being, morality, and even immortality. ([Location 2032](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=2032))
- “processes” refers to those events that occur in nature, ... Such processes have nothing to do with human intelligence, are governed by immutable laws, and are, so to say, determined by the structure of nature. ([Location 2048](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=2048))
- What we may call science, then, is the quest to find the immutable and universal laws that govern processes, presuming that there are cause-and-effect relations among these processes. It follows that the quest to understand human behavior and feeling can in no sense except the most trivial be called science. ([Location 2057](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=2057))
    - Note: Is this always true, or only because we are not sophisticated enough yet?
- At best, sociologists (to take one example) use quantification merely to give some precision to their ideas. But there is nothing especially scientific in that. ([Location 2062](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=2062))
- in their quest for objectivity, scientists proceed on the assumption that the objects they study are indifferent to the fact that they are being studied. ([Location 2077](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=2077))
- If a theory cannot be tested for its falsity, it is not a scientific theory—as, ([Location 2086](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=2086))
- the stories of social researchers are much closer in structure and purpose to what is called imaginative literature; that is to say, both a social researcher and a novelist give unique interpretations to a set of human events and support their interpretations with examples in various forms. Their interpretations cannot be proved or disproved but will draw their appeal from the power of their language, the depth of their explanations, the relevance of their examples, and the credibility of their themes. ([Location 2136](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=2136))
- They are bound by time, by situation, and above all by the cultural prejudices of the researcher or writer. ([Location 2142](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=2142))
- It has been remarked about the brothers Henry and William James that Henry was the novelist who wrote like a psychologist, and William the psychologist who wrote like a novelist. ([Location 2154](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=2154))
- Kinsey’s story, therefore, we may call a documentary. But, like all stories, it is infused with moral prejudice and sociological theory. ([Location 2159](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=2159))
- in the nineteenth century, novelists provided us with most of the powerful metaphors and images of our culture. In the twentieth century, such metaphors and images have come largely from the pens of social historians and researchers. ([Location 2168](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=2168))
- We might even say that in Technopoly precise knowledge is preferred to truthful knowledge but that in any case Technopoly wishes to solve, once and for all, the dilemma of subjectivity. ([Location 2192](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=2192))
- In Technopoly, it is not enough to say it is immoral and degrading to allow people to be homeless. You cannot get anywhere by asking a judge, a politician, or a bureaucrat to read Les Misérables or Nana or, indeed, the New Testament. You must show that statistics have produced data revealing the homeless to be unhappy and to be a drain on the economy. ([Location 2206](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=2206))
- science, social research, and the kind of work we call imaginative literature are three quite different kinds of enterprise. In the end, all of them are forms of storytelling—human attempts to account for our experience in coherent ways. But they have different aims, ask different questions, follow different procedures, and give different meanings to “truth.” In most of these respects, social research has little in common with science, and much in common with other forms of imaginative literature. ([Location 2211](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=2211))
- the desacralized world has been searching for an alternative source of moral authority ([Location 2229](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=2229))
- That is why social “scientists” are so often to be found on our television screens, and on our bestseller lists, and in the “self-help” sections of airport bookstands: not because they can tell us how some humans sometimes behave but because they purport to tell us how we should; not because they speak to us as fellow humans who have lived longer, or experienced more of human suffering, or thought more deeply and reasoned more carefully about some set of problems, but because they consent to maintain the illusion that it is their data, their procedures, their science, and not themselves, that speak. ([Location 2240](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=2240))
    - Note: We might say that they speak more about what is...not what should be
- This, then, is what I mean by Scientism. It is not merely the misapplication of techniques such as quantification to questions where numbers have nothing to say; not merely the confusion of the material and social realms of human experience; not merely the claim of social researchers to be applying the aims and procedures of natural science to the human world. Scientism is all of these, but something profoundly more. It is the desperate hope, and wish, and ultimately the illusory belief that some standardized set of procedures called “science” can provide us with an unimpeachable source of moral authority, ([Location 2247](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=2247))
### 10 The Great Symbol Drain
- In Technopoly, the trivialization of significant cultural symbols is largely conducted by commercial enterprise. ([Location 2288](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=2288))
- When the scale of accessibility was altered, Boorstin argues, the experience of encountering an image necessarily changed; that is to say, it diminished in importance. One picture, we are told, is worth a thousand words. But a thousand pictures, especially if they are of the same object, may not be worth anything at all. ([Location 2303](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=2303))
- the journey to meaninglessness of symbols is a function not only of the frequency with which they are invoked but of the indiscriminate contexts in which they are used. ([Location 2312](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=2312))
- Irreverence, after all, is an antidote to excessive or artificial piety, and is especially necessary when piety is used as a political weapon. One might say that irreverence, not blasphemy, is the ultimate answer to idolatry, which is why most cultures have established means by which irreverence may be expressed—in the theater, in jokes, in song, in political rhetoric, even in holidays. ([Location 2318](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=2318))
- there is nothing in the commercial exploitation of traditional symbols that suggests an excess of piety is itself a vice. Business is too serious a business for that, and in any case has no objection to piety, as long as it is directed toward the idea of consumption, which is never treated as a laughing matter. ([Location 2322](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=2322))
- In using Uncle Sam or the flag or the American Eagle or images of presidents, in employing such names as Liberty Insurance, Freedom Transmission Repair, and Lincoln Savings and Loan, business does not offer us examples of irreverence. It is merely declaring the irrelevance, in Technopoly, of distinguishing between the sacred and the profane. ([Location 2324](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=2324))
- during the period of greatest industrial growth in America—from roughly 1830 to the end of the nineteenth century—advertising did not play a major role in the economy, and such advertising as existed used straightforward language, without recourse to the exploitation of important cultural symbols. ([Location 2328](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=2328))
- advertising is most effective when it is irrational. By irrational, I do not, of course, mean crazy. I mean that products could best be sold by exploiting the magical and even poetical powers of language and pictures. ([Location 2347](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=2347))
- Advertising became one part depth psychology, one part aesthetic theory. In the process, a fundamental principle of capitalist ideology was rejected: namely, that the producer and consumer were engaged in a rational enterprise in which consumers made choices on the basis of a careful consideration of the quality of a product and their own self-interest. ([Location 2351](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=2351))
- What the advertiser needs to know is not what is right about the product but what is wrong about the buyer. And so the balance of business expenditures shifts from product research to market research, which means orienting business away from making products of value and toward making consumers feel valuable. The business of business becomes pseudo-therapy; the consumer, a patient reassured by psychodramas. ([Location 2358](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=2358))
- Tradition is, in fact, nothing but the acknowledgment of the authority of symbols and the relevance of the narratives that gave birth to them. With the erosion of symbols there follows a loss of narrative, which is one of the most debilitating consequences of Technopoly’s power. ([Location 2372](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=2372))
- cultures must have narratives and will find them where they will, even if they lead to catastrophe. The alternative is to live without meaning, the ultimate negation of life itself. It is also to the point to say that each narrative is given its form and its emotional texture through a cluster of symbols that call for respect and allegiance, even devotion. ([Location 2400](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=2400))
- The story each suggests is that the United States is not a culture but merely an economy, which is the last refuge of an exhausted philosophy of education. ([Location 2416](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=2416))
- the present condition of technology-generated information is so long, varied, and dynamic that it is not possible to organize it into a coherent educational program. ([Location 2448](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=2448))
- What you have to do to be a success must be addressed only after you have found a reason to be successful. In Technopoly, this is very hard to ([Location 2457](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=2457))
- American professors have lost their nerve. They have become moral relativists, incapable of providing their students with a clear understanding of what is right thought and proper behavior. Moreover, they are also intellectual relativists, refusing to defend their own culture and no longer committed to preserving and transmitting the best that has been thought and said. ([Location 2459](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=2459))
- Into this void comes the Technopoly story, with its emphasis on progress without limits, rights without responsibilities, and technology without cost. The Technopoly story is without a moral center. It puts in its place efficiency, interest, and economic advance. It promises heaven on earth through the conveniences of technological progress. It casts aside all traditional narratives and symbols that suggest stability and orderliness, and tells, instead, of a life of skills, technical expertise, and the ecstasy of consumption. Its purpose is to produce functionaries for an ongoing Technopoly. ([Location 2485](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=2485))
### 11 The Loving Resistance Fighter
- As I see it, a reasonable response (hardly a solution) to the problem of living in a developing Technopoly can be divided into two parts: what the individual can do irrespective of what the culture is doing; and what the culture can do irrespective of what any individual is doing. ([Location 2514](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=2514))
- No one is an expert on how to live a life. ([Location 2518](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=2518))
    - Note: But this is where you were saying the traditions and institutions helped...So which is best, or do we need a new one.
- You must try to be a loving resistance fighter. ... By “loving,” I mean that, in spite of the confusion, errors, and stupidities you see around you, you must always keep close to your heart the narratives and symbols that once made the United States the hope of the world and that may yet have enough vitality to do so again. ([Location 2519](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=2519))
- Can a nation allow the greatest possible degree of political and religious freedom and still retain a sense of identity and purpose? ([Location 2533](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=2533))
- Can a nation retain a sense of cohesion and community by allowing into it people from all over the world? ([Location 2535](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=2535))
    - Note: Warning: nationalism territory
- Can a nation preserve its history, originality, and humanity by submitting itself totally to the sovereignty of a technological thought-world? ([Location 2536](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=2536))
- who pay no attention to a poll unless they know what questions were asked, and why; who refuse to accept efficiency as the pre-eminent goal of human relations; who have freed themselves from the belief in the magical powers of numbers, do not regard calculation as an adequate substitute for judgment, or precision as a synonym for truth; who refuse to allow psychology or any “social science” to pre-empt the language and thought of common sense; who are, at least, suspicious of the idea of progress, and who do not confuse information with understanding; who do not regard the aged as irrelevant; who take seriously the meaning of family loyalty and honor, and who, when they “reach out and touch someone,” expect that person to be in the same room; who take the great narratives of religion seriously and who do not believe that science is the only system of thought capable of producing truth; who know the difference between the sacred and the profane, and who do not wink at tradition for modernity’s sake; who admire technological ingenuity but do not think it represents the highest possible form of human achievement. ([Location 2541](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=2541))
- A resistance fighter understands that technology must never be accepted as part of the natural order of things, that every technology—from an IQ test to an automobile to a television set to a computer—is a product of a particular economic and political context and carries with it a program, an agenda, and a philosophy that may or may not be life-enhancing and that therefore require scrutiny, criticism, and control. In short, a technological resistance fighter maintains an epistemological and psychic distance from any technology, so that it always appears somewhat strange, never inevitable, never natural. ([Location 2554](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=2554))
- I can say no more than this, for each person must decide how to enact these ideas. ([Location 2559](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=2559))
    - Note: But this is contrary to his main point about how things should be. Falling for is over ought.
- as Lawrence Cremin once remarked, whenever we need a revolution, we get a new curriculum. ([Location 2564](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=2564))
- perhaps the most important contribution schools can make to the education of our youth is to give them a sense of coherence in their studies, a sense of purpose, meaning, and interconnectedness in what they learn. ([Location 2569](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=2569))
- It does not even put forward a clear vision of what constitutes an educated person, unless it is a person who possesses “skills.” In other words, a technocrat’s ideal—a person with no commitment and no point of view but with plenty of marketable skills. ([Location 2573](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=2573))
- But there are some points about history and its teaching that require stressing, since they are usually ignored by our schools. The first is that history is not merely one subject among many that may be taught; every subject has a history, including biology, physics, mathematics, literature, music, and art. I would propose here that every teacher must be a history teacher. To teach, for example, what we know about biology today without also teaching what we once knew, or thought we knew, is to reduce knowledge to a mere consumer product. It is to deprive students of a sense of the meaning of what we know, and of how we know. ([Location 2619](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=2619))
- In one sense, there is no such thing as “history,” for every historian from Thucydides to Toynbee has known that his stories must be told from a special point of view that will reflect his particular theory of social development. And historians also know that they write histories for some particular purpose—more often than not, either to glorify or to condemn the present. There is no definitive history of anything; there are only histories, human inventions which do not give us the answer, but give us only those answers called forth by the questions that have been asked. ([Location 2641](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=2641))
- many people still believe that what makes a statement scientific is that it can be verified. In fact, exactly the opposite is the case: What separates scientific statements from nonscientific statements is that the former can be subjected to the test of falsifiability. What makes science possible is not our ability to recognize “truth” but our ability to recognize falsehood. ([Location 2683](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=2683))
- Like history, semantics is an interdisciplinary subject: it is necessary to know something about it in order to understand any subject. ([Location 2695](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=2695))
- Students who have a firm grounding in semantics are therefore apt to find it difficult to take reading tests. A reading test does not invite one to ask whether or not what is written is true. Or, if it is true, what it has to do with anything. The study of semantics insists upon these questions. ([Location 2710](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=2710))
- In brief, we need students who will understand the relationships between our technics and our social and psychic worlds, so that they may begin informed conversations about where technology is taking us and how. ([Location 2745](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=2745))
- The course would be descriptive, promoting no particular religion but illuminating the metaphors, the literature, the art, the ritual of religious expression itself. ([Location 2750](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=2750))
    - Note: Again, this seems counter to his whole point.
- To summarize: I am proposing, as a beginning, a curriculum in which all subjects are presented as a stage in humanity’s historical development; in which the philosophies of science, of history, of language, of technology, and of religion are taught; and in which there is a strong emphasis on classical forms of artistic expression. This is a curriculum that goes “back to the basics,” but not quite in the way the technocrats mean it. And it is most certainly in opposition to the spirit of Technopoly. ([Location 2756](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZJBW4&location=2756))
