## Highlights
### Preface
- the success of lean manufacturing rested on a deep understanding of what creates value, why rapid flow is essential, and how to release the brainpower of the people doing the work. ([Location 253](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=253))
- we learned that by focusing on value, flow, and people, you got better quality, lower cost, and faster delivery. ([Location 277](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=277))
### Introduction
- We observe that some methods still considered standard practice for developing software have long been abandoned by other disciplines. ([Location 306](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=306))
- Companies that develop software as a product or part of a product should find the lessons from product development particularly germane. ([Location 314](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=314))
- Toyota and Honda had discovered a different way to avoid the penalty of incorrect design decisions: Don’t make irreversible decisions in the first place; delay design decisions as long as possible, and when they are made, make them with the best available information to make them correctly. ([Location 331](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=331))
- the theory behind lean development borrows heavily from the theory of lean manufacturing, so lean principles in general are both understood and proven by managers in many disciplines outside of software development. ([Location 345](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=345))
- Principles are guiding ideas and insights about a discipline, while practices are what you actually do to carry out principles. ([Location 351](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=351))
    - Tags: [[definition]] 
- the problems that arise when applying metaphors from other disciplines to software development are often the result of trying to transfer the practices rather than the principles of the other discipline. ([Location 355](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=355))
- Practices for one domain will not necessarily apply to other domains. Principles, however, are broadly applicable across domains as long as the guiding principles are translated into appropriate practices for each domain. ([Location 357](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=357))
- This book focuses on the process of translating lean principles to agile practices tailored to individual software development domains. ([Location 359](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=359))
- 1. Eliminate waste. ([Location 374](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=374))
- Whatever gets in the way of rapidly satisfying a customer need is waste. ([Location 379](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=379))
- 2. Amplify learning. ([Location 380](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=380))
- 3. Decide as late as possible. ([Location 389](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=389))
- A key strategy for delaying commitments when developing a complex system is to build a capacity for change into the system. ([Location 393](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=393))
- 4. Deliver as fast as possible. ([Location 394](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=394))
- In development the discovery cycle is critical for learning: Design, implement, feedback, improve. The shorter these cycles are, the more can be learned. ([Location 397](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=397))
- 5. Empower the team. ([Location 401](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=401))
- Because decisions are made late and execution is fast, it is not possible for a central authority to orchestrate activities of workers. Thus, lean practices use pull techniques to schedule work and contain local signaling mechanisms so workers can let each other know what needs to be done. ([Location 405](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=405))
- Local signaling occurs through visible charts, daily meetings, frequent integration, and comprehensive testing. ([Location 408](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=408))
- 6. Build integrity in. ([Location 409](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=409))
- Conceptual integrity means that the system’s central concepts work together as a smooth, cohesive whole, and it is a critical factor in creating perceived integrity. ([Location 411](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=411))
    - Tags: [[definition]] 
- Research has shown that integrity comes from wise leadership, relevant expertise, effective communication, and healthy discipline; processes, procedures, and measurements are not adequate substitutes. ([Location 415](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=415))
- 7. See the whole. ([Location 417](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=417))
- the common good suffers if people attend first to their own specialized interests. When individuals or organizations are measured on their specialized contribution rather than overall performance, suboptimization is likely to result. ([Location 420](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=420))
### Chapter 1. Eliminate Waste
- anything that does not create value for a customer is waste. ([Location 463](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=463))
    - Tags: [[definition]] 
- Eliminating waste is the most fundamental lean principle, the one from which all the other principles follow. ([Location 477](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=477))
- Thus, the first step to implementing lean development is learning to see waste. The second step is to uncover the biggest sources of waste and eliminate them. The next step is to uncover the biggest remaining sources of waste and eliminate them. The next step is to do it again. ([Location 478](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=478))
- We worked together on every problem, trying mightily not to dump it in the other person’s lap. We found that difficult problems got resolved easier with both of us working on them, and usually there was a problem on both sides anyway. ([Location 500](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=500))
#### Tool 1: Seeing Waste
- If something does not directly add value as perceived by the customer, it is waste. If there is a way to do without it, it is waste. ([Location 515](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=515))
    - Tags: [[favorite]] 
- Partially done development ties up resources in investments that have yet to yield results. ([Location 533](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=533))
- Minimizing partially done software development is a risk-reduction as well as a waste-reduction strategy. ([Location 536](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=536))
- If you must produce paperwork that adds little customer value, there are three rules to remember: Keep it short. Keep it high level. Do it off line. ([Location 541](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=541))
- Safety-critical systems are frequently regulated and are often required to have written requirements, traceable to code. In this case, formatting the requirements so they can be easily evaluated and checked for completeness may qualify as a value-adding activity. __Look for a table-driven or template-driven format that reduces the requirements to a condensed format that both users and developers can rapidly understand and validate.__ ([Location 543](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=543))
    - Tags: [[prodsec]] 
- A good test of the value of paperwork is to see if there is someone waiting for what is being produced. ([Location 546](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=546))
- Every bit of code increases complexity and is a potential failure point. ([Location 554](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=554))
- The fastest way to complete two projects that use the same resources is to do them one at a time. ([Location 560](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=560))
    - Tags: [[favorite]] 
    - Note: and often the second one gets done faster than even the first one would be done if both were worked at the same time
- You cannot delay decisions, however, if you cannot implement rapidly once a decision is made. ([Location 578](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=578))
- The amount of waste caused by a defect is the product of the defect impact and the time it goes undetected. ([Location 590](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=590))
    - Tags: [[definition]] 
- The way to reduce the impact of defects is to find them as soon as they occur. Thus, the way to reduce the waste due to defects is to test immediately, integrate often, and release to production as soon as possible. ([Location 592](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=592))
- Project tracking and control systems also do not add value, and further, they may be an indication of too much work in the system. ([Location 598](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=598))
- Before building a complicated tracking system, minimize the tracking problem by making sure that work flows rapidly through the system. ([Location 602](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=602))
#### Tool 2: Value Stream Mapping
- At the bottom of the map, draw a timeline that shows how much time the request spends in value-adding activities, and how much time it spends in waiting states and non-value adding activities. ([Location 627](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=627))
- Once you have a map, pick the biggest opportunities to increase flow and value-added time, and send your team after them. Then, update your value stream map, pick the next biggest opportunities, and repeat the process. ([Location 662](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=662))
#### Try This
- 1. Make a list of the 10 or 15 most important activities in your organization. Put yourself in the shoes of a customer and rate each item from 1 to 5, with 1 meaning customers probably don’t care about the activity and 5 meaning customers value it highly. Think of the low-scoring activities as waste. Take the two lowest scoring items and develop a plan to cut the time on these activities in half. ([Location 677](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=677))
    - Tags: [[inbox]] 
- 2. At your next seven team meetings, take some time to discuss each of the seven wastes of software development, one at a time: Partially done work Extra processes Extra features Task switching Waiting Motion Defects For each waste, ask the questions Do you agree that this “waste” is really a waste? Why or why not? Whether or not you agree that the item is a waste, estimate how much time it consumes in an average week. What can or should be done to reduce that time? ([Location 681](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=681))
    - Tags: [[inbox]] 
- 3. Develop a value stream map for your organization. Start with an incoming request and map a timeline of its progress to providing customer value. Find out how much of the time is spent adding value and how much is spent waiting. Take the biggest cause of delay and develop a plan to cut it in half. ([Location 694](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=694))

### Chapter 2. Amplify Learning
- Many attempts to apply lean production practices to software development have been unsuccessful because generating good software is not a production process; it is a development process. Development is quite different than production. Think of development as creating a recipe and production as following the recipe. ([Location 712](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=712))
- The service view of quality takes into account that every customer has a different idea of what constitutes a quality experience. In a service economy, quality does not mean conformance to a script; it means adapting to meet the changing expectations of many different customers. ([Location 733](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=733))
- Quality in software development results in a system with both perceived integrity and conceptual integrity. Perceived integrity means that the totality of the product achieves a balance of function, usability, reliability, and economy that delights customers.3 Conceptual integrity4 means that the system’s central concepts work together as a smooth, cohesive whole. ([Location 736](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=736))
    - Tags: [[definition]] 
- a system with perceived integrity is one that continues to solve the problem in an effective manner. Thus, quality in design means realization of purpose or fitness for use rather than conformance to requirements. ([Location 743](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=743))
    - Tags: [[definition]] 
- Guindon found that cycling between high-level design and detailed solution was typical of good designers when dealing with ill-structured problems, that is, problems that do not have a single right answer or a best way to arrive at a solution. ([Location 761](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=761))
- For complex problems, the preferred approach to a solution is to use the scientific method: observe, create a hypothesis, devise an experiment to test the hypothesis, run the experiment, and see if the results are consistent with the hypothesis. ([Location 772](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=772))
- The right the first time approach may work for well-structured problems, but the try-it, test-it, fix-it approach is usually the better approach for ill-structured problems. ([Location 780](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=780))
- Your objective should be to balance experimentation with deliberation and review. In order to do this, consider how you can generate the most knowledge at the least cost in your circumstances. For instance, if the cost of testing is very high, you will want more knowledge to be generated through deliberation and review. If experimentation is relatively inexpensive and yields better knowledge faster, then it is the least expensive, most effective approach. ([Location 786](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=786))
- Iterations with refactoring—improving the design as the system develops—have been found to be one of the most effective ways to generate knowledge, find answers early, and generate a system with integrity, because this approach generates knowledge most effectively for ill-defined problems. ([Location 796](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=796))
- The important question in development is, How can I learn most effectively? The answer is often to have many short learning cycles. ([Location 798](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=798))
#### Tool 3: Feedback
- As actually implemented, the sequential, or waterfall, development model does not usually provide for much feedback; it is generally thought of as a single-pass model. This can be called a deterministic model because it assumes that the details of a project are determined at the beginning. A deterministic model is favored by project management disciplines that have their origins in contract administration. The contract-inspired model of project management generally favors a sequential development process with specifications fixed at the start of the project, customer sign-off on the specifications, and a change authorization process intended to minimize changes. There is a perception that these processes give greater control and predictability, although sequential development processes with low feedback have a dismal record in this regard.15 ([Location 856](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=856))
- The conventional wisdom in project management values managing scope, cost, and schedule to the original plan. Sometimes this is done at the expense of receiving and acting on feedback that might change the plan; sometimes it is done at the expense of achieving the overall business goal. This mental model is so entrenched in project management thinking that its underlying assumptions are rarely questioned. ([Location 864](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=864))
- In most cases, increasing feedback, not decreasing it, is the single most effective way to deal with troubled software development projects and environments. ([Location 881](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=881))

- Instead of letting defects accumulate, run tests as soon as the code is written. Instead of adding more documentation or detailed planning, try checking out ideas by writing code. Instead of gathering more requirements from users, show them an assortment of potential user screens and get their input. Instead of studying more carefully which tool to use, bring the top three candidates inhouse and test them. Instead of trying to figure out how to convert an entire system in a single massive effort, create a Web front end to the legacy system and try the new idea out. ([Location 883](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=883))

- Whenever people do work, they should be doing it for an immediate customer; that is, someone, somewhere, should be eager to make use of the results of their work. Developers should know their immediate customers and have ways for those customers to provide regular feedback. When a problem develops, the first thing to do is to make sure the feedback loops are all in place; that is, make sure everyone knows who his or her immediate customer is. The next thing to do is to increase the frequency of the feedback loops in the problem areas. ([Location 891](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=891))
#### Tool 4: Iterations
- just-in-time inventory flow. The simple act of working to fill customer orders rather than working to meet a schedule drives a host of other improvements. One reason just-in-time flow is so effective is that it requires significantly improved worker-to-worker communication and surfaces quality problems as soon as they occur. ([Location 907](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=907))
- An iteration is a useful increment of software that is designed, programmed, tested, integrated, and delivered during a short, fixed timeframe. It is very similar to a prototype in product development except that an iteration produces a working portion of the final product. ([Location 916](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=916))
    - Tags: [[definition]] 
- Iterations provide a dramatic increase in feedback over sequential software development, thus providing much broader communication between customers/users and developers, and among various people who have an interest in the system. ([Location 918](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=918))
- options-based approaches are fundamentally risk-reduction strategies, and as counterintuitive as it may sound, you actually reduce your risk by keeping options open rather than freezing design early. ([Location 928](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=928))
- Frequent points of synchronization allow teams to work independently yet never stray far from the work of other teams or the interests of customers and users. ([Location 932](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=932))
- If a feature cannot be done in a single iteration, it should be broken down into smaller features. Features come from customers or customer representatives in the form of use cases, stories, or backlog items. ([Location 937](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=937))
- High-risk items should be addressed earlier rather than later. ([Location 941](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=941))
- How long should the iteration time-box be? It should be long enough to support a meaningful design-build-test cycle and short enough to provide frequent feedback from customers that the system is on track. ([Location 943](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=943))
- The development team must be free to accept only the amount of work for an iteration that team members believe they can complete within the time-box. ([Location 947](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=947))
- If a development team overcommits—which often happens to inexperienced teams—it is best to deliver some of the features on time rather than all of them late. ([Location 950](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=950))
- The team must be small and staffed with the necessary expertise. Some team members must be experienced in the domain and some in each critical technology. ([Location 957](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=957))
- The team must have or create the basic environment for good programming: – Automated build process – Automated testing – Coding standards – Version Control Tool – Etc. ([Location 964](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=964))
- This is a valid concern; how can you be sure that any system with a feedback loop will converge on a solution? ([Location 976](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=976))
- in general, environments that are more dynamic require more rapid feedback. ([Location 993](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=993))
- Some have found that larger teams do better with more frequent feedback, because if a large team gets off track, it is more difficult to reverse direction. ([Location 993](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=993))
- A good strategy for achieving convergence is to work on top priority items first, leaving the low priority items to fall off the to-do list. By delivering high priority features first, it is likely that you will deliver most of the business value long before the customer’s wish list is completed. ([Location 995](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=995))
- Since customers often don’t know exactly what they want at the beginning of a project, they tend to ask for everything they think they might need, especially if they think they will get only one shot at it. ([Location 1007](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=1007))
- By tracking the team velocity, you can forecast from past work how much work will probably be done in the future. Velocity measurements are significantly more accurate tools than scope-based controls because they measure how much time it actually took to deliver complete, tested, releasable code at the end of each iteration. ([Location 1014](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=1014))
    - Tags: [[definition]] 
- It is a good idea to make progress visible to both the development team and the customer. ([Location 1018](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=1018))
- burn-down charts. ([Location 1019](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=1019))
    - Tags: [[definition]] 
#### Tool 5: Synchronization
- Whenever several individuals are working on the same thing, a need for synchronization occurs. ([Location 1041](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=1041))
- This technique is often called the daily build and smoke test. ([Location 1052](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=1052))
    - Tags: [[definition]] 
- More frequent builds are better; they provide much more rapid feedback. ([Location 1054](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=1054))
- The general principle is that if builds and test suites take too long, they will not be used, so invest in making them fast. ([Location 1058](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=1058))
- This provides a bias toward more frequent builds with less comprehensive tests, but it is still important to run all the tests overnight or every weekend. ([Location 1058](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=1058))
- The span of a build and test operation is an important development decision. ([Location 1062](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=1062))
    - Tags: [[definition]] 
- Remember the rule of small batches: If you integrate changes in small batches, it will be infinitely easier to detect and fix problems. ([Location 1064](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=1064))
- The goal should be to have workable code at the end of every day. ([Location 1065](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=1065))
- Therefore, the matrix approach starts by developing the interfaces and then the subsystems. All points of cross-team interaction should be laid out at the beginning; teams should be assigned to each of these interaction points. The interface should be developed first, stubbing out the components to allow the cross-component software to be demonstrated. ([Location 1083](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=1083))

#### Tool 6: Set-Based Development
- In set-based development, communication is about constraints, not choices. This turns out to be a very powerful form of communication, requiring significantly less data to convey far more information. In addition, talking about constraints instead of choices defers making choices until they have to be made, ([Location 1111](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=1111))
    - Tags: [[definition]] 
- So how do you apply set-based development to software? You develop multiple options, communicate constraints, and let solutions emerge. ([Location 1141](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=1141))
- Set-based development does not replace iterative development—it adds a new dimension. During early iterations, multiple choices are developed for key features; in later iterations, they are merged or narrowed to a single choice. ([Location 1167](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=1167))
- Set-based development means that you communicate constraints, not solutions. ([Location 1170](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=1170))
- Communicating constraints is very useful when tackling a particularly difficult problem, because it helps assure that the solution is worked out by all concerned. ([Location 1184](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=1184))
- keep the constraints of the problem visible so that the team can discover the intersection of the design space that will work for all concerned. ([Location 1186](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=1186))
#### Try This
- Take your most difficult problem and devise a way to increase feedback. a. Increase the feedback of development teams to management by asking each team at the end of each iteration the following questions: i. Was the team properly staffed for this iteration? ii. Were there any needed resources that were not forthcoming? iii. How can things be changed to make things go better and faster? iv. What is getting in the way? b. Increase the feedback of customers to development teams by holding a customer focus group at the end of each iteration. Ask questions such as the following: i. How well does this section solve the problem it was meant to solve? ii. How could it be improved? iii. How does this iteration affect your view of what you need? iv. What do you need to put this part of the system into production? c. Increase the feedback of the product to the development team in the following ways: i. Have developers write and run developer tests as they write the code. ii. Have analysts, customers, or testers write and run customer tests as the developers work on the code. Have developers help with the customer tests if that’s what it takes to get them automated. iii. Have developers observe usability tests of each feature as it nears completion, so they can see how users react to their implementation. d. Increase the feedback within the team in the following ways: i. Make testers an integral part of the development team. ii. Involve operations people at the beginning of the project. iii. Establish the policy that the development team maintains the product. ([Location 1202](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=1202))

- 2. Start iterations with a negotiation session between customers and developers.

### Chapter 3. Decide as Late as Possible
- The problem with sequential development is that it forces designers to take a depth-first rather than a breadth-first approach to design. Depth-first forces making low-level dependent decisions before experiencing the consequences of the high-level decisions. ([Location 1324](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=1324))
- Concurrent development allows you to take a breadth-first approach and discover those big, costly problems before it’s too late. ([Location 1330](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=1330))
- There are some critical skills that must be in place in order for concurrent development to work. ([Location 1339](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=1339))
- concurrent software development requires developers with enough expertise in the domain to anticipate where the emerging design is likely to lead and close collaboration with the customers and analysts who are designing how the system will solve the business problem at hand. ([Location 1345](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=1345))
- This presents us with a new category of waste: waste caused by software that is difficult to change. ([Location 1352](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=1352))
- Not all change is equal. There are a few basic architectural decisions that you need to get right at the beginning of development, because they fix the constraints of the system for its life. Examples of these may be choice of language, architectural layering decisions, or the choice to interact with an existing database also used by other applications. These kinds of decisions might have the 100:1 cost escalation ratio. Because these decisions are so crucial, you should focus on minimizing the number of these high-stakes constraints. You also want to take a breadth-first approach to these high-stakes decisions. ([Location 1366](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=1366))
- Concurrent design defers decisions as late as possible. This has four effects: Reduces the number of high-stake constraints. Gives a breadth-first approach to high-stakes decisions, making it more likely that they will be made correctly. Defers the bulk of the decisions, significantly reducing the need for change. Dramatically decreases the cost escalation factor for most changes. ([Location 1372](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=1372))
- Lean software development emphasizes developing a robust, change-tolerant design, one that accepts the inevitability of change and structures the system so that it can be readily adapted to the most likely kinds of changes. ([Location 1389](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=1389))
- The idea is to build tolerance for change into the system along domain dimensions that are likely to change. Observing where the changes occur during iterative development gives a good indication of where the system is likely to need flexibility in the future. ([Location 1393](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=1393))
- The secret is to know enough about the domain to maintain flexibility, yet avoid making things any more complex than they must be. ([Location 1396](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=1396))
#### Tool 7: Options Thinking
- As a keynote speaker at a software conference,12 Enrico Zaninotto, an Italian economist, pointed out that the underlying economic mechanism for controlling complexity in just-in-time systems is minimizing irreversible actions. ([Location 1423](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=1423))
- Delaying irreversible decisions until uncertainty is reduced has economic value. It leads to better decisions, it limits risk, it helps manage complexity, it reduces waste, and it makes customers happy. ([Location 1433](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=1433))
- The financial and commodities markets have developed a mechanism—called options—to allow decisions to be delayed. An option is the right, but not the obligation, to do something in the future. ([Location 1437](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=1437))
    - Tags: [[definition]] 
- In general, financial options give the buyer an opportunity to capitalize on positive events in the future while limiting exposure to negative events. ([Location 1449](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=1449))
- Agile software development processes can be thought of as creating options that allow decisions to be delayed until the customer needs are more clearly understood and evolving technologies have had time to mature. This is not to say that agile approaches are unplanned. Plans help clarify confusing situations, allow consideration of tradeoffs, and establish patterns that allow rapid action. So, plans tend to enhance the flexibility to respond to change. ([Location 1476](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=1476))
- Plans and predictions are not bad, but making irrevocable decisions based on speculation is to be avoided. ([Location 1484](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=1484))
- Options thinking is an important tool in software development as long as it is accompanied by recognition that options are not free and it takes expertise to know which options to keep open. ([Location 1490](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=1490))
#### Tool 8: The Last Responsible Moment
- Concurrent development makes it possible to delay commitment until the last responsible moment,16 that is, the moment at which failing to make a decision eliminates an important alternative. ([Location 1495](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=1495))
    - Tags: [[definition]] 
##### Share partially complete design information.
##### Organize for direct, worker-to-worker collaboration.
- This requires that people who understand the details of what the system must do to provide value must communicate directly with people who understand the details of how the code works. ([Location 1505](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=1505))
##### Develop a sense of how to absorb changes.
- Experts repair their errors before they cause problems. Amateurs try to get everything right the first time and so overload their problem-solving capacity that they end up committing early to wrong decisions. ([Location 1508](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=1508))
- Use interfaces: Separate interfaces from implementations. Clients should not depend on implementation decisions. ([Location 1514](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=1514))
- Avoid repetition: This is variously known as the Don’t Repeat Yourself (DRY)17 or Once And Only Once (OAOO)18 principle. ([Location 1527](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=1527))
    - Tags: [[definition]] 
##### Develop a sense of what is critically important in the domain.
- If security, or response time, or failsafe operation are critically important in the domain, these issues need to be considered from the start; ([Location 1546](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=1546))
##### Develop a sense of when decisions must be made.
##### Develop a quick response capability.
- The slower you respond, the earlier you have to make decisions. ([Location 1554](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=1554))
#### Tool 9: Making Decisions
- Breadth-first problem solving might be thought of as funnel, while depth-first problem solving is more like a tunnel. ([Location 1559](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=1559))
- The risk of depth-first problem solving is that the field under consideration will be narrowed too soon, especially if those making the early commitments are not experts in the domain. ([Location 1564](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=1564))
- Even though rational analysis gives specific answers, these are based on fuzzy assumptions and it is difficult to know exactly when and how to apply the rules. ([Location 1600](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=1600))
- would be nice if rational analysis could be counted on to point out when there is an inconsistency, when there is a key factor that everyone is overlooking. However, rational analysis is less useful than intuition in this regard, because rational analysis tends to remove context from analysis. Thus, rational decision making is unlikely to detect high-stakes mistakes; intuitive decision making is better in this regard. ([Location 1602](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=1602))
- It is much more important to develop people with the expertise to make wise decisions than it is to develop decision-making processes that purportedly think for people. ([Location 1606](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=1606))
- Instead, the planning process focuses on understanding the essence of the situation and the strengths and weaknesses of both sides; finding simplifying assumptions, boundary conditions, and alternate approaches; settling on an approach with a 70 percent chance of success; searching for what is being overlooked; and inviting dissent. ([Location 1616](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=1616))
- A clear statement of intent is the key to enabling emergent behavior on the front line. In business, the communicating intent is generally done through a small set of well chosen, simple rules. ([Location 1635](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=1635))
- simple rules are a key mechanism to enable people to decide as late as possible. ([Location 1671](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=1671))
- Simple rules give people a framework for making decisions; they are not instructions telling people exactly what to do. ([Location 1674](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=1674))
- Simple rules should be limited to the few key principles that really must be considered when making a decision. Quite often, simple rules are used to reinforce a paradigm shift, so they often focus on the counterintuitive elements of decision making. ([Location 1678](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=1678))
- A set of simple rules are guideposts; their purpose is to allow the people on the ground to make quick decisions about how to proceed, knowing that their decisions will not be second-guessed because they are making the same decision their managers would make given the same circumstances. ([Location 1690](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=1690))
#### Try This
- 2. At a team or department meeting, ask people to list decisions that are about to be made. Group the list of decisions into two categories—tough to make and easy to make. Then discuss what information you would need to turn each tough decision into an easy decision. Pick three tough decisions and apply the delaying tactics under “Tool 8: The Last Responsible Moment” to delay those decisions as long as possible.

### Chapter 4. Deliver as Fast as Possible
- Rapid delivery allows some customers to delay decisions, and for others rapid delivery means quicker gratification. For customers of software development, rapid delivery often translates to increased business flexibility. ([Location 1786](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=1786))
- When work-in-process represents risk, rapid delivery reduces risk. ([Location 1790](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=1790))
- A big pile of in-process work holds additional risks besides obsolescence. Problems and defects, both large and small, often lurk in piles of partially done work. When developers create a lot of code without testing, defects pile up. When code is developed but not integrated, the high risk part of the effort usually remains. When a system is complete but not in production, risks remain. All of these risks can be significantly reduced by shortening the value stream. ([Location 1795](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=1795))
- Finally, the principle deliver as fast as possible complements decide as late as possible. The faster you can deliver, the longer you can delay decisions. ([Location 1798](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=1798))
#### Tool 10: Pull Systems
- There are two ways to assure that workers make the most effective use of their time. You can either tell them what to do or set things up so they can figure it out for themselves. In a fast-moving environment, only the second option works. ([Location 1806](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=1806))
- When things are happening quickly, there is not enough time for information to travel up the chain of command and then come back down as directives. Therefore, methods for local signaling and commitment must be developed to coordinate work. One of the keys ways to do this is to let customers’ needs pull the work rather than have a schedule push the work. ([Location 1810](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=1810))
    - Tags: [[definition]] 
- The simple mathematical fact working here is that variation is always amplified as it moves down a chain of connected events. A little variation in step one introduces a huge variation five steps later. ([Location 1822](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=1822))
- Pull systems use a mechanism called kanban, which was originally patterned after restocking grocery store shelves.4 Kanban means sign or placard in Japanese. ([Location 1827](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=1827))
    - Tags: [[definition]] 
- When people show up at work, they look at their pile of kanban cards and know exactly what to do next. If they have more than one kanban card, they have simple rules which tell them which customer to restock first. If they have no kanban cards, they clean up their workstation and perhaps help the people at a customer workstation so as to generate some kanban cards to work on. ([Location 1835](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=1835))
- Unlike other scheduling mechanisms, pull systems take variability into account at the end of the line, so there is very little nervousness. ([Location 1840](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=1840))
- The interesting thing about pull scheduling is that it takes the manager out of the loop of having to tell workers what to do. The work is self-directing. The managers spend their time coaching the team.6 ([Location 1844](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=1844))
- Furthermore, telling developers what to do does not generate much motivation. ([Location 1867](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=1867))
- The starting point for a pull system in software development is short iterations based on customer input at the beginning of each iteration.9 ([Location 1876](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=1876))
- The scheme is not as important as the effect: The kanban cards tell developers what to do. The work becomes self-directing, pulled from customer-selected features. Status is visible at a glance to anyone who cares to check the board. ([Location 1888](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=1888))
- At the daily meeting, team members give a summary of what they did yesterday, what they plan to do today, and where they need help. ([Location 1894](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=1894))
- The job of the leader, or coach, is to run interference for the team. ([Location 1896](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=1896))
- A pull system in software development requires short time-boxes—a month or less—otherwise, it can degenerate into a push system. If the iteration is too long, there will be too many cards or else the cards will not be detailed enough to effectively pull work. ([Location 1898](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=1898))
- One of the features of a pull system is visual control, or management by sight.12 If work is going to be self-directing, then everyone must be able to see what is going on, what needs to be done, what problems exist, what progress is being made. ([Location 1902](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=1902))

    - Tags: [[definition]] 
- Lists of problems, ideas for improvements, candidates for refactoring, business impact of the system to date, daily build status, glossaries of the ubiquitous language, database test beds, testing backlog—all are candidates for entry onto a big, visible chart. Information radiators make problems visible, telegraph progress, and are an enabling mechanism for self-directing work. ([Location 1910](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=1910))
#### Tool 11: Queuing Theory
- The fundamental measurement of a queue is cycle time—that is, the average time it takes something to get from one end of a process to the other. The cycle time clock starts when something enters a queue and keeps on ticking away while it waits in the queue, while it gets service, while it waits in the next queue, gets the next service, and so on, until it pops out at the other end of the process. ([Location 1924](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=1924))
    - Tags: [[definition]] 
- The time spent waiting in the queue is wasted time. ([Location 1932](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=1932))
- There are two ways to reduce cycle time; one is to look at the way work arrives and the other is to look at the way work is processed. ([Location 1934](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=1934))
- One way to control the rate of work arrival is to release small packages of work. ([Location 1939](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=1939))
- Small work packages are a real help in removing variability from processing time, because a small package has fewer things that can go wrong. ([Location 1951](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=1951))
- Not only will small work packages flow much more easily through your system, they will also allow parallel processing of the small jobs by multiple teams so that if one is stalled by a problem, the rest of the project can proceed without delay. ([Location 1957](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=1957))
- If you have a process that involves several steps, then the processing time at the earlier steps will affect the rate at which work arrives at the later stations. If you have big processing variations in upstream workstations, these cascade throughout the system. Thus, it is a good idea to try to move any variability downstream. ([Location 1959](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=1959))
- In his book Slack, Tom DeMarco makes the point that having slack in an organization gives it the capacity to change, to reinvent itself, and to marshal resources for growth. ([Location 1995](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=1995))
- you probably are not providing your customers with the highest level of service if you have no slack in your organization. ([Location 1998](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=1998))
- The way to increase throughput is to look for the current bottleneck that is slowing things down and fix it. Once that is done, find the next bottleneck and fix it. Keep this up and you will have a fast moving value stream. Note that it doesn’t do any good to increase the utilization of non-bottleneck areas. ([Location 2002](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=2002))
- Here is a quick summary of how queues work:
  1. Measuring the amount of work waiting to be done (let’s call this work-in-queue) is equivalent to measuring the cycle time of a system.
  2. As variability (in arrival time or processing time) increases, cycle time and work-in-queue will increase.
  3. As batch size increases, variability in arrival and processing time increases, and therefore cycle time and work-in-queue will increase.
  4. As utilization increases, cycle time will increase nonlinearly.
  5. As variability increases, the nonlinear increase in cycle time happens at ever-lower levels of utilization.
  6. Continuous flow requires a reduction in variability.
  7. Variability may be reduced by an even arrival of demand, small batches, an even rate of processing, and parallel processing.
  8. Decreasing variability early in the process has larger impact than decreasing variability late in the process. ([Location 2008](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=2008))
#### Tool 12: Cost of Delay
- If your software development organization is not involved in product development, it is useful to develop an economic model of each application from the customer point of view. This is a simplified way of evaluating how different design decisions will affect the business value received by the customer ([Location 2092](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=2092))
- Tradeoffs are easiest to make if they are expressed in the same units. How can a developer decide if it is better to save a week, save $10,000, or add new features? ([Location 2129](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=2129))
    - Tags: [[favorite]] 
- We suggest that basing development decisions on economic models helps the development team make good tradeoff decisions. Providing intelligent people with guidelines for making tradeoffs leads to more effective decisions, to developers who feel empowered, and to an organization that is most likely to be able to respond to and thrive in a competitive environment. ([Location 2133](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=2133))
- Finally, economic models may help you justify the cost of reducing cycle time, eliminating bottlenecks, and purchasing tools that will allow you to deliver as fast as possible. ([Location 2136](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=2136))
#### Try This
- 1. Create a single place where everyone who is interested in a project can come to see:
  a. The goal of the current iteration, and
  i. what has already been done
  ii. what is being done
  iii. what has yet to be done
  b. The mission of the overall project, and
  i. what has already been done to meet the project mission

- Insofar as it has been used as a certification program, CMM has had an impact similar to ISO9000. Both tend to create bureaucracy and make change difficult, even though it is not the intention of either program to do so. ([Location 2232](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=2232))
- ISO9000 programs should not be thought of as process improvement programs, because they have a bias toward documenting and thus standardizing existing processes rather than improving the processes. ([Location 2233](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=2233))
- Similarly, when CMM programs are implemented with a focus on documentation and conformance to a particular best way to do a job, they may standardize on less than ideal practices and create a bias against change. Thus they may be better implemented separate from—and after—process improvements. ([Location 2236](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=2236))
- A bias against process change is not the most difficult issue with programs such as ISO9000 and CMM. As frequently implemented, these programs tend to remove process design and decision-making authority from developers and put it under the control of central organizations. Developers often equate people from the central organization to the stopwatch wielding industrial engineers from the days of scientific management who know the one best way for them to do their job. Lean thinking capitalizes on the intelligence of frontline workers, believing that they are the ones who should determine and continually improve the way they do their jobs. ([Location 2238](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=2238))
- We believe that the critical factor in motivation is not measurement, but empowerment: moving decisions to the lowest possible level in an organization while developing the capacity of those people to make decisions wisely. ([Location 2247](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=2247))
- We have a different model of what maturity means: Lean Assumption 1: A mature organization looks at the whole system; it does not focus on optimizing disaggregated parts.10 Lean Assumption 2: A mature organization focuses on learning effectively and empowers the people who do the work to make decisions. ([Location 2259](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=2259))
- An organization that respects software developers as professionals will expect them to design their own jobs with proper training, coaching, and assistance. It will expect them to improve continually the way they do their work as part of a learning process. Finally, it will give them the time and equipment necessary to do their jobs well. ([Location 2267](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=2267))
#### Tool 13: Self-Determination
- We believe that transferring practices from one environment to another is often a mistake. Instead, one must understand the fundamental principles behind practices and transform those principles into new practices for a new environment. ([Location 2304](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=2304))
- In Work-Out the tables are turned; workers tell managers how to let them do their jobs. A Work-Out is a process that teaches managers how to listen to workers, charter them to take action on their ideas, and follow up to be sure that approved proposals are implemented promptly. ([Location 2343](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=2343))
#### Tool 14: Motivation
##### Start with a clear and compelling purpose.
##### Be sure the purpose is achievable.
##### Give the team access to customers.
##### Let the team make its own commitments.
##### Management’s role is to run interference.
- Leaders may not be able to satisfy every request, but the team will maintain momentum if its members know they have someone who is looking out for them. ([Location 2419](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=2419))
##### Keep skeptics away from the team.
- Nothing kills a purpose faster than someone who knows it can’t be done and has plenty of good reasons why. ([Location 2422](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=2422))
- People need to believe they are capable of doing a good job; they want to be involved in something that they believe will work. It is very motivating to be part of a winning team, very demotivating to believe that failure is inevitable. ([Location 2466](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=2466))
- Projects should have meaningful measurements that show progress toward the goal posted in a place for everyone to see. ([Location 2482](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=2482))
- A couple of cautions are in order. First, long hours and late nights are not a sustainable mode of operating, and generally they do not result in better work. People get careless when they are tired; it’s often better to quit for the day at a reasonable hour and come back fresh the next day. Second, excited, passionate teams may create a climate in which people are expected to work long hours and late nights. This is not fair for those who would not choose such dedication but for peer pressure, and it may result in subtle discrimination. ([Location 2495](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=2495))
- It is better to encourage moderation than heroism. If a dedicated team is working at a sustainable pace and an emergency comes up, the members will rise to the occasion. If they are seriously overcommitted already, they can’t respond to an emergency. ([Location 2502](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=2502))
#### Tool 15: Leadership
- In software development we have used terms such as systems engineer, chief programmer, and architect to designate the role of the exceptional designer. For purposes of this book, we use the term master developer to designate the role of respected leader of a software development project. ([Location 2535](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=2535))
    - Tags: [[definition]] 
- Those with a bias toward sequential development would like to see all design done prior to the start of programming. Agile approaches recognize that architectures evolve and mature; the practical approach is to provide for an emerging design rather than try to stop it. The real question is, When has enough design been done for developers to start working? This is where master developers fit in—they are the ones who make the call. It is the responsibility of master developers to judge the level of initial conceptual design necessary at the beginning of concurrent development, facilitate the emergence of the design as development proceeds, and assure that there are no downstream surprises that should have been anticipated. Development should begin as soon as a conceptual design is articulated at a high level. ([Location 2559](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=2559))
- Some domains might lend themselves to immediate experimentation; others may have concerns, such as safety or security, which require more consideration. ([Location 2567](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=2567))
- An organization has to value leadership in order to develop leaders. We notice that organizations that hold technical leaders in high esteem seem to have plenty of these leaders grow up from the ranks. They have a built-in leadership apprenticeship program because they have an assortment of different programs where people can learn the craft of leadership. They often have dual ladders, which allow technical leaders to achieve the same status and pay as supervisors and managers. ([Location 2582](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=2582))
- Project leaders play an important role in an agile project; it’s just not the role they learned at their project management class. ([Location 2603](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=2603))
- Lean Project Management Training Most of the topics covered in a traditional project management course are not what an agile project leader needs to know. We recommend an alternate toolkit for project leaders: 1. Seeing Waste 2. Value Stream Mapping 3. Feedback 4. Iterations 5. Synchronization 6. Set-Based Development 7. Options Thinking 8. Last Responsible Moment 9. Making Decisions 10. Pull Systems 11. Queuing Theory 12. Cost of Delay 13. Self Determination 14. Motivation 15. Leadership 16. Expertise 17. Perceived Integrity 18. Conceptual Integrity 19. Testing 20. Refactoring 21. Measurements 22. Contracts ([Location 2609](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=2609))
    - Note: the 22 tools in the book
#### Tool 16: Expertise
- What PARC researchers discovered is that technicians across the company had developed small communities of expertise to deal with difficult repair problems that fell off the map of the official documentation. Together with PARC, technicians found a way to spread the community across the company. In effect, the technicians developed a community of scientists who discovered solutions through experimentation, wrote up the results, and submitted them for publication. The tips were reviewed and replicated by peers, and published with due credit in a database widely used by the community. Useful tips gained wide peer recognition for the technician who submitted it. ([Location 2661](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=2661))
    - Tags: [[definition]] 
- if your company writes health-care software or security software, it is important to develop expertise in these domains. If you are going to have a competitive advantage in the marketplace, you need to have areas of expertise in your organization that don’t exist in competing companies. Even if your organization serves a customer internal to your company, you would do well to understand what particular expertise your group brings to the company that can’t be obtained by outsourcing.

    - Tags: [[favorite]] 
- At the same time, matrixed value-added team leaders view their jobs as enablers and motivators who gather resources and remove obstacles, and as guides who represent the voice of the customer to the team. ([Location 2685](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=2685))
- it is usually better for a program team to work with existing standards than to develop their own. One way to discover where a community of expertise is needed is to identify where standards are lacking. ([Location 2705](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=2705))
- sharing. If you find areas where standards seem to be lacking and sloppy work is evident, foster communities of expertise and ask the communities to develop standards. ([Location 2727](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=2727))
#### Try This
- 1. At the end of each iteration, do a process check with the team. Asks two questions: a. What is slowing you down or getting in the way of doing a good job? b. What would help things move faster, better, cheaper? Make a list of bad and good practices. Decide which items on the first list can be eliminated and which on the second list can be implemented. Then make it happen. Don’t do this just once—repeat it after each iteration. ([Location 2731](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=2731))
    - Tags: [[inbox]] 
- 2. Make sure that the development team starts each iteration by writing down the goal of the iteration. The goal should be one or two sentences that give the iteration a theme related to the business value it will deliver. Post the goal in a prominent spot and refer to it when the team is struggling with a tough decision. ([Location 2736](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=2736))
    - Tags: [[inbox]] 
- 4. Ask each person on the development team to write down one specialty area in which the team is low on expertise. List everyone’s answers and look for a pattern. Have team members pick their top candidate and see which one gets the most votes. Then work with the team to come up with a plan to make that expertise more available to the team. You might use the following strategies: a. Buy everyone who is interested a relevant book and meet once a week at lunch to discuss a chapter. b. Find a guru in the specialty in question and have him or her pair with various team members, as availability permits, so they can strengthen their skill in the area. c. Set up a three-person subcommittee to establish team conventions for the area in question. Be sure they evaluate any corporate or industry standards in preference to designing their own.

### Chapter 6. Build Integrity In
- product integrity has two dimensions: external integrity and internal integrity.1 In this book, we rename these two dimensions: perceived integrity and conceptual integrity. Perceived integrity means that the totality of the product achieves a balance of function, usability, reliability, and economy that delights customers. Conceptual integrity means that the system’s central concepts work together as a smooth, cohesive whole. ([Location 2826](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=2826))
    - Note: .d
- Perceived integrity is affected by the customer’s whole experience of a system: how it’s advertised, delivered, installed, accessed; how intuitive it is to use; how well it deals with idiosyncrasies; how well it keeps up with changes in the domain; how much it cost; how timely it is; how well it solves the problem. ([Location 2846](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=2846))
- Conceptual integrity means that a system’s central concepts work together as a smooth, cohesive whole. The components match and work well together; the architecture achieves an effective balance between flexibility, maintainability, efficiency, and responsiveness. ([Location 2865](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=2865))
- Conceptual integrity is a prerequisite for perceived integrity. When a system does not have a consistent set of design ideas, usability will suffer, because the user does not have a single metaphor for the application, strategies for doing the application, and user-interface tactics. ([Location 2869](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=2869))
- Although conceptual integrity is necessary for perceived integrity, it is not sufficient. ([Location 2875](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=2875))
- Perceived integrity is a reflection of the integrity of the information flow from customers and users to developers. ([Location 2881](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=2881))
- three fundamental requirements for improved software development performance are Increased application domain knowledge across the entire software development staff. Acceptance of change as an ordinary process and the capability to accommodate emergent design decisions. An environment that enhances communication to integrate people, tools, and information. ([Location 2888](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=2888))
- Tool 17: Perceived Integrity ([Location 2894](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=2894))
- If the vision of perceived integrity isn’t refreshed regularly, the engineers have a tendency to get lost in the technical details and forget the customer values. ([Location 2899](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=2899))
- Chief engineers are among the most highly skilled engineers in the organization. They have added to their engineering skills the ability to understand their target customer base and create a vision of a car that these customers will buy. In addition, they must have the leadership skills necessary to transmit this vision on a daily basis to the people making detailed decisions and tradeoffs. ([Location 2900](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=2900))
- Customers know what their problems are, but quite often, they can’t describe the solution. ([Location 2915](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=2915))
- In Domain Driven Design Eric Evans advocates model-driven design, that is, the construction of a domain model such that software implementation can flow directly from this model. Domain models must be both understood and directly usable by the customers or customer representatives and by the developers actually writing the code. ([Location 2941](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=2941))
    - Tags: [[definition]] 
- A glossary. This defines the terms found in the domain model and ensures a consistent language for the team. ([Location 2971](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=2971))
- It is okay to create models that are useful for a time and eventually fall into disuse. But it is a waste to create and maintain models simply because it seems like a good idea. You know you have devised a useful model when it is eagerly referenced and maintained. ([Location 2989](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=2989))
- The key to communication about complex systems is to hide details behind abstractions when a broad picture is desired and move to lower levels of abstraction to flesh out the details. ([Location 2996](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=2996))
- A change-tolerant design process is more likely to result in a change-tolerant system. ([Location 3010](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=3010))
- One way to maintain intuitional memory about a system is to make the developers responsible for ongoing updates. ([Location 3014](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=3014))
- best way to maintain institutional knowledge about a system and keep it maintainable is to deliver a suite of automated tests along with the code, supplemented by a high-level overview model created at the end of the initial development effort. ([Location 3016](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=3016))
#### Tool 18: Conceptual Integrity
- The second practice automotive companies use to achieve conceptual integrity is to use integrated problem solving to assure excellent technical information flow. ([Location 3033](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=3033))
    - Tags: [[definition]] 
- With integrated problem solving, illustrated in Figure 6.3, the picture changes to one of early, frequent, and bilateral communication. This rich, bilateral communication deemphasizes control mechanisms in favor of face-to-face discussions, small batches, speed, and flow. ([Location 3061](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=3061))
- Since you can’t build complete flexibility into a system, you should try to group things that are likely to change together and hide them from the rest of the system. ([Location 3086](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=3086))
- First, use existing parts when possible. This means use off-the-shelf software when possible. It means putting a wrapper around legacy databases if you can. Use standards such as XML and Web-browser clients. Allow users to export data to spreadsheets and manipulate it. By fixing as many points of the system as feasible with existing software and standards, you reduce the communication required, clearing the path for better communication on the remainder of the system. ([Location 3098](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=3098))
#### Tool 19: Refactoring
- Improvement comes not just from meeting customer demands or adding features; improvements are also necessary because complex systems have effects that are not well understood at design time. ([Location 3119](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=3119))
- The more complex the system, the more important design evolution becomes. ([Location 3126](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=3126))
- Regular refactoring is what keeps systems healthy over time. ([Location 3151](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=3151))
##### 1. Simplicity.
##### 2. Clarity.
##### 3. Suitability for Use.
##### 4. No Repetition.
- The evil of duplication extends beyond code. Every piece of knowledge should have a single, authoritative, ambiguous representation in the system. ([Location 3171](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=3171))
##### 5. No Extra Features.
- You can take an option on the future by delaying decisions, but don’t predict the future by providing extra features before they are needed. ([Location 3176](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=3176))
- When a developer finds something wrong with the code base, something that interferes with the smooth flow of development or its smooth execution, then she or he should stop the line—stop adding new features. The team should take the time to find and fix the root cause of the problem before proceeding with more development. ([Location 3178](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=3178))
- Okay, you say, but there isn’t time to stop development to improve the design. We would argue that there isn’t time not to refactor. Work will only go slower as the code becomes complex and obscure. As suggested by Figure 6.4, incurring a refactoring debt will kill team productivity. ([Location 3190](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=3190))
- Refactoring is not waste; on the contrary, refactoring is a key method for avoiding waste in providing business value to customers. ([Location 3196](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=3196))
#### Tool 20: Testing
- These tests have been categorized as unit tests, system tests, and integration tests. As we move from programming one module at a time to programming entire capabilities and features, the distinction between unit, system, and integration tests has less meaning. A better name for these tests might be developer tests, because their purpose is to assure that code does what the developer intended it to do. ([Location 3209](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=3209))
    - Tags: [[definition]] 
    - Note: d
- A better name for tests that make sure that a system does what customers intend is customer tests, since their purpose is to assure that the system will do what customers expect it to do. Customer tests are run throughout the development, not just at the end. ([Location 3214](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=3214))
    - Tags: [[definition]] 
- Customer tests can be a viable replacement for, or supplement to, most requirements documents. ([Location 3225](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=3225))
- The implementation is not complete until the design details are exercised by developer tests. ([Location 3229](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=3229))
- When a developer writes code, she or he should get immediate feedback about whether the code works as intended. ([Location 3235](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=3235))
- development is a cycle of experiments with a successful test at the end of each cycle. ([Location 3238](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=3238))
- To make changes safely, there must be a way to immediately find and fix unintended consequences. The most effective way to facilitate change is to have an automated test suite that tests the mechanisms the developers intend to implement and the behavior the customers need to have. ([Location 3253](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=3253))
- The thing you need to do is capture those tests, make sure they are correct and complete, put them under version control, automate them, consider them as part of the released product, and continue to use and improve them. ([Location 3261](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=3261))
- However, if a system has a comprehensive test suite that contains both developer tests and customer tests, those tests will in fact be an accurate as-built reflection of the system. If the tests are clear and well organized, they are an invaluable resource for understanding how the system works from a developer’s and a customer’s point of view. ([Location 3274](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=3274))
- You will get more payoffs from an effective test program than from most other investments you might make. ([Location 3282](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=3282))
- It is also a good idea to have the development team retain responsibility for application maintenance to preserve domain learning. ([Location 3287](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=3287))
- Scaffolding is as useful for maintenance as it was for the original construction. ([Location 3291](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=3291))
#### Try This
- 1. Pick one of your current systems and find out if it has a common language. Chat with the customers and write down a glossary of what they consider key terms that they use when talking about the system. Take this glossary to the development team and find out if they use the same words or if they have a technical translation for some domain terms. Next, ask the developers to identify in the code the names they use for each word in the combined glossary. Finally, see if there are any key classes in the systems that are not represented in the glossary. If you detect that there are two or three different vocabularies in use, explain to the development team why it is important for them to use the domain language, even among themselves.

- 2. Hold a team meeting and invite any of the following people who normally would not be there. People who will
  a. test the system
  b. deploy the system
  c. train the users
  d. be responsible for operating the system in production
  e. work at a help desk for the system
  f. maintain the system
  g. develop or maintain any system accessing the same data
  Have the assembled group brainstorm any concerns they have about the system under development. Then, use prioritization to pick the three most important issues. Form a joint committee of interested parties to address the three issues. Meet again in two weeks to be sure the three issues have been resolved, and repeat the process.

No Extra Features Ask each developer to note on the appropriate piece of paper anything in the current system that does not seem to meet the standard. For instance, if they detect repetition, they would note the culprits on the No Repetition sheet. When refactoring has removed an offending item, it is crossed off the list. At the end of the iteration, let the team take a day or two to clean up the worst offenders on the charts. ([Location 3315](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=3315))

- 4. Estimate the average cycle time of the following:
  a. Time from writing feature until developer test is run.
  b. Time from writing feature until it is integrated into system and automated developer test suite is run.
  c. Time from writing feature until customer test is run.
  d. Time from writing feature until usability test is run.
  e. Time from writing feature until deployment.
  Next, write down a target cycle time for each item. Attack this list from top to bottom: Work with the team to come up with a plan to bring each cycle time down to its target number, and one by one, close the gap.

- the ability of a system to achieve its purpose depends on how well the parts work together, not just how well they perform individually. ([Location 3377](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=3377))

- One of the basic patterns in systems thinking is called limits to growth.2 Even as a process produces a desired result, it creates a secondary effect that balances and eventually slows down the success. If you continue to push on the same process for increased success, you will amplify the secondary effect and start a downward spiral. Instead of pushing growth, find and remove the limits to growth. ([Location 3394](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=3394))
    - Tags: [[definition]] 
- Finding and removing the limits to growth is the fundamental teaching of the theory of constraints. ([Location 3398](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=3398))
- A second basic pattern in systems thinking is called shifting the burden. In this pattern, an underlying problem produces symptoms that can’t be ignored. However, the underlying problem is difficult to confront, so people address the symptoms instead of the root cause of the problem. Unfortunately, the quick fix allows the underlying problem to grow worse, unnoticed because its symptoms have been covered up. ([Location 3401](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=3401))
    - Tags: [[inbox]] [[favorite]] 
- Lean thinking uses five whys to counter the tendency to shift the burden to symptoms rather than addressing the root cause of a problem. ([Location 3405](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=3405))
- A third basic pattern in systems thinking is suboptimization. The more complex a system, the more temptation there is to divide it into parts and manage the parts locally. Local management tends to create local measurements of performance. These local measurements often create systemwide effects that decrease overall performance, yet the impact of local optimization on overall results is often hidden. ([Location 3415](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=3415))
    - Tags: [[inbox]] 
#### Tool 21: Measurements
- One of the more challenging problems in measuring performance is that measurements occur at local levels, but maximizing local measurements is often at crosspurposes with optimizing the organization as a whole. ([Location 3458](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=3458))
- Nucor addresses this issue by basing incentives on measurements one level higher than one would expect. ([Location 3467](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=3467))
- The detrimental effects of local measurements on overall performance are usually hidden, and so we persist in using suboptimized measurements out of superstition and habit. ([Location 3471](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=3471))
- The way to be sure that everything is measured is by aggregation, not disaggregation. That is, move the measurement one level up, not one level down. ([Location 3520](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=3520))
- it is important to aggregate performance measurements rather than attribute them to individuals. ([Location 3527](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=3527))
- The problem with attributing defects to developers lies in the assumption that individuals personally cause the defects. ([Location 3529](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=3529))
- trying to attribute defects to individual developers is a case of shifting the burden. We are not looking for the root causes of the problems if we trace defects to individuals; rather, we are hiding them. ([Location 3535](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=3535))

#### Tool 22: Contracts
- Dyer defines trust as “one party’s confidence that the other party...will fulfill its promises and will not exploit its vulnerabilities.” Many people think that the reason for contracts is to substitute for this trust. ([Location 3603](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=3603))
    - Tags: [[definition]] 
- So, when evaluating the cost of outsourcing, it is imperative that all costs are considered: direct costs, obvious transaction costs, and hidden costs that come from arm’s-length relationships and change intolerance. ([Location 3624](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=3624))
- Another motivator for fixed-price contracts is the desire of a customer to transfer risk to the vendor. In practice, the customer can’t really transfer the bulk of the risk. If the contract doesn’t work out, the customer will suffer. ([Location 3637](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=3637))
- If a problem is technically complex, then the vendor is most likely to be in a position to manage the associated risk, so it is appropriate for the vendor to assume the risk. However, if a problem is uncertain or changing, then the customer is in the best position to manage the risk, so fixed-price contracts should be avoided. If a fixed-price contract cannot be avoided, then the customer should be willing to incur a substantial cost beyond the fixed price, due to the certainty of changes. ([Location 3652](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=3652))
- The process of selecting a vendor for a fixed-price contract has a tendency to favor the most optimistic—or the most desperate—vendor. Consequently, the vendor least likely to understand the project’s complexity is likely to be selected. Thus, fixed-price contracts tend to select the vendor most likely to get in trouble. ([Location 3657](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=3657))
- The flexible-price contract, also known as a time-and-materials or time-and-expenses contract, is designed to deal with uncertainty and complexity, but it does not do away with risk; it simply shifts it from the vendor to the customer. ([Location 3670](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=3670))
    - Tags: [[definition]] 
- Time-and-materials contracts mark a significant increase in contract transaction costs. Companies with DoD contracts not only hire administrators to oversee compliance with contract requirements, they also add accountants to sort out allowable and unallowable costs. High transaction costs would be reasonable if they added value, but in fact transaction costs are by definition nonvalue-adding costs. ([Location 3677](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=3677))
- When you think about it, concurrent development is a safer approach for time-and-materials contracts than is sequential development and its associated controls. Exchanging incremental value for incremental pay protects both vendor and customer. However, this approach requires that the project management systems commonly used for sequential development be set aside. ([Location 3697](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=3697))
- Multistage contracts create what might be called a bilateral monopoly,32 that is, both sides come to depend on each other. If one party ends its involvement, the other party may have a lot to lose. ([Location 3712](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=3712))
- One way to mitigate the risk posed by the bilateral monopoly in multistage contracts is to deliver value with each increment in proportion to the money spent. ([Location 3714](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=3714))
- The problem with traditional fixed-price contracts is that they encourage self-serving behavior on the part of the customer and defensive behavior on the part of the vendor. The problem with traditional time-and-materials contracts is exactly the opposite: They encourage self-serving behavior on the part of vendor and defensive, control-oriented behavior on the part of customers. What we need is a middle ground, one in which risk is shared and both parties have incentives to look out for the overall interests of the joint effort. ([Location 3749](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=3749))
- Target-cost contracts are structured so that the total cost—including changes—is the joint responsibility of the customer and vendor. ([Location 3757](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=3757))
    - Tags: [[definition]] 
- Cost plus fixed fee: The target cost does not include profit for the vendor; a separate fee is included to provide vendor profit. The fee is generally paid after the work is successfully completed. ([Location 3771](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=3771))
- Profit not to exceed: The target cost includes the vendor profit. The vendor agrees to reduce rates and exclude profit after the target cost is reached. If total cost exceeds target cost, the vendor works at cost. ([Location 3775](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=3775))
- Target-cost contracts must leave the details of the scope to the discretion of the technical teams, because reducing scope is the most fertile ground for cost control. ([Location 3780](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=3780))
- If the number of people working on the system does not change and no components are purchased or licensed, then target cost and target schedule are the same thing. ([Location 3822](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=3822))
- In the same way, a target-cost contract can usually be run as a target-schedule contract by fixing the resources and schedule. Features should be addressed in priority order, and each iteration should deliver working, tested, integrated, deployable software. Well before the deadline, the software should actually be deployed. Then, iterations can continue to deal with issues that arise in production. ([Location 3826](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=3826))
    - Note: ,d
- A profit-sharing contract is another effective mechanism for sharing risks and rewards if you are developing products for sale. ([Location 3836](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=3836))
    - Tags: [[definition]] 
- In a co-source contract, both companies share responsibility for developing a system, and the vendor is also expected to transfer its expertise to the customer. A co-source contract is successful if the vendor works itself out of a job by helping the customers develop the capability to do the work themselves. ([Location 3838](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=3838))
    - Tags: [[definition]] 
- We have noted several types of contracts that can work for agile software development: Time-and-material contracts using concurrent development with highest priority features implemented first and working, integrated code delivered at each iteration so that the customer may easily manage cost by limiting scope. Multistage contracts using a master contract and work orders to release each iteration, with similar emphasis on concurrent development, highest priority features first, and working, integrated code delivered at each iteration. Target-cost contracts, which charter the frontline workers of both parties to work together to come up with a solution to the problem that meets a target cost, giving them the freedom to limit scope as a primary mechanism to achieve the target cost. Shared-benefit contracts that assume the parties will modify what they are doing as time goes on to achieve mutual benefit. There is a common theme here: All of these contracts are mechanisms that avoid fixing scope in detail. ([Location 3867](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=3867))
- The bottom line? Organizations that use outsourcing as a way to save money will save more money overall if they collaborate with vendors by using some form of optional scope contract. ([Location 3886](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=3886))
#### Try This
- 1. Make sure your defect measurement system is an informational measurement system rather than a performance measurement system. a. Are defects traceable back to the developer who caused the defect? Why? If there is no good reason, then eliminate the person’s identity from the defect reporting system; don’t even collect the names. b. If there is a reason why you need a developer’s identity (e.g., the developer must fix the code), then be sure that an individual developer is the only one who sees the reports related to his or her work. Aggregate all defect reports; do not publicly display or manage from defect measurements sorted by developer.

- 2. Whether you outsource or are a contractor, the first step to using agile methods under contract is to figure out a way to make scope optional. Ask your legal team to scour the available literature on methods to provide adequate protection to your company without using a fixed-scope specification.

### Chapter 8. Instructions and Warranty
- Avoid creating a pendulum that swings from high ceremony to low ceremony and back; look for the balance point of the lean principles. ([Location 3972](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=3972))
- • Eliminate waste does not mean throw away all documentation. • Amplify learning does not mean keep on changing your mind. • Decide as late as possible does not mean procrastinate. • Deliver as fast as possible does not mean rush and do sloppy work. • Empower the team does not mean abandon leadership. • Build integrity in does not mean big, upfront design. • See the whole does not mean ignore the details. ([Location 3974](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=3974))
- Create a coalition. Find like-minded souls, especially among your peers, and form a study group. Create a group consensus about how to translate the principles into agile practices that make sense and will have an impact on your problems. ([Location 4005](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=4005))
    - Tags: [[inbox]] 
- In the face of resistance, address the fear. • Resistance indicates a perceived threat to a largely unconscious belief system, one that has no doubt successfully guided the organization in the past. A organization’s belief system leads to actions that reinforce the beliefs, creating a self-fulfilling prophecy that tends to blocks out new ideas.3 • Resistance is a sign that you have triggered a fear. This isn’t all bad; it means you have injected a new idea into the system, which is the first step to changing the belief system. • Recognize that resistance is a symptom, and the cause lies in the belief system that is being threatened. You need to uncover and address the belief system that underlies the fear.4 Of course, this isn’t easy, because the belief system has no doubt led to success in the past, so it will fight back with many varieties of self-fulfilling prophecies.

- therefore a competent assessor should recognize a well-implemented agile ecosystem at CMM level 3 or higher.5 The approach may not be traditional, but it works. CMM is not supposed to dictate approach, but only assess if the existing approach addresses known software development failure modes. ([Location 4043](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=4043))
- Start with hygiene. First of all, make sure that you have basic professional software development practices in place: a version-controlled code repository, coding standards, build automation, comprehensive testing, etc. ([Location 4068](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=4068))
- Focus. Do not try to do too many things at once or to improve everything at the same time. Find the one unique thing that you can do better than anyone else and focus all of your attention on doing that very well. Collaborate with others to provide breadth.

- When failure is not an option. Sometimes software can kill people if it malfunctions, and when that is the case, there are many regulations on how to assure the software is failsafe. However, even safety-critical systems can be improved with agile software development approaches. Generally a process that encourages safety evaluations periodically throughout development will be superior to a process that depends upon a one-time safety evaluation at the beginning of a project.8 ([Location 4087](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=4087))
- In case of difficulty, additional applications of the principle see the whole are recommended. In particular, apply the following three high leverage practices: • When a problem appears, stop everything: find and fix its root cause. • Identify your biggest constraint and direct all effort toward removing it. • Move your focus up one level and optimize the whole system. ([Location 4112](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=4112))
- This warranty is invalid if practices are transferred directly from other disciplines or domains without thinking, or if the principles of empower the team and build integrity in are ignored. ([Location 4121](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HEL13HW&location=4121))
