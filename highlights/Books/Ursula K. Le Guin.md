## Highlights
### INTRODUCTION Fear and Loathing in the Interview
- Nothing cures nervousness quicker than getting interested in the conversation. ([Location 48](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079571KS2&location=48))
### ON FICTION
- In the arts, imitation has to be understood by the person doing it as a learning device; otherwise it’s plagiarism. You imitate only to learn, and you don’t publish it. Or if you do, you say, “This is an imitation of Hemingway.” ([Location 94](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079571KS2&location=94))

- Nothing’s deader than last year’s trend. ([Location 234](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079571KS2&location=234))

- if you read only contemporary stuff, always third-person limited, you don’t realize that point of view in a story is very important and can be very movable. It’s here where I suggest that people read books like Woolf’s To the Lighthouse to see what she does by moving from mind to mind. Or Tolstoy’s War and Peace for goodness’ sake. Wow. The way he slides from one point of view to another without you knowing that you’ve changed point of view—he does it so gracefully. You know where you are, whose eyes you are seeing through, but you don’t have the sense of being jerked from place to place. That’s mastery of a craft.

- you say that story is about conflict, that plot must be based on conflict, you’re limiting your view of the world severely. And in a sense making a political statement: that life is conflict, so in stories conflict is all that really matters. This is simply untrue. To see life as a battle is a narrow, social-Darwinist view, and a very masculine one. Conflict, of course, is part of life, I’m not saying you should try to keep it out of your stories, just that it’s not their only lifeblood. Stories are about a lot of different things.

- The Lathe of Heaven is an obvious example of using a Taoist approach to life. Though I didn’t use the I Ching to write the book, the way Philip K. Dick did to write The Man in the High Castle, the movement is continuous change, and in Lathe it happens through dreams. So you never quite know if it is a dream or if it is real. That is my book where the Asian influence is most clearly on the surface. ([Location 336](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079571KS2&location=336))

### ON POETRY
- DN: You end Late in the Day with a transcript of this speech. In it you say that resistance and change often begin in art, and that most often it is in the art of words that you see the beginnings of resistance and change. UKL: After all, dictators are always afraid of poets. This seems kind of weird to a lot of Americans to whom poets are not political beings, but it doesn’t seem a bit weird in South America or in any dictatorship, really.

### ON NONFICTION
- deep, permanent effect on me, too. Unfortunately, when White incorporated The Sword in the Stone into The Once and Future King, he left out some of the very best of it—cut marvelous, mystical things, added political rants. Most people who know both think it was a mistake, and you should get the old book if you can find it. ([Location 871](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079571KS2&location=871))

- But then, okay, if you politicize that to the extent that you say nobody can speak for anybody else, then you get into a mess. Because what we need to say is __nobody can speak for anybody who doesn’t have a voice__. ([Location 950](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079571KS2&location=950))
