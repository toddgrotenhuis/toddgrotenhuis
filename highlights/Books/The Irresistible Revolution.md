## Highlights
- Our battle then was against a private piety that limited religion to only personal matters, then compromised faith in a tragic capitulation to the economic, political, and military powers that be. ([Location 117](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00UF72BAK&location=117))
- Meanwhile, many of us find ourselves estranged from the narrow issues that define conservatives and from the shallow spirituality that marks liberals. ([Location 158](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00UF72BAK&location=158))
- The whisper cries out for God to save the church from us Christians and breathe new life into the aging Body. ([Location 212](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00UF72BAK&location=212))
- As with any label—anarchist, activist, radical, Christian—I want to make sure we have a proper understanding before I answer. ([Location 214](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00UF72BAK&location=214))
- If by evangelical we mean one who spreads the good news that there is another kingdom or superpower, an economy and a peace other than that of the nations, a savior other than Caesar, then yes, I am an evangelical. ([Location 219](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00UF72BAK&location=219))
- a faith that has as much to say about this world as it does about the next. New prophets are rising up who try to change the future, not just predict it. ([Location 225](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00UF72BAK&location=225))
- doing small things with great love. ([Location 239](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00UF72BAK&location=239))
- The biblical prophets talked about the beasts of the empire and the market. ([Location 244](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00UF72BAK&location=244))
- Dualism has infected the church, a dualism in which folks separate the spiritual from the political or social, as if the political and social issues were of no spiritual significance, and as if God had no better vision to offer this world. ([Location 276](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00UF72BAK&location=276))

- We believe Jesus actually meant the stuff he said. We rejoice that Jesus has survived the embarrassing things we Christians have done in his name. And we want our Christianity to look like Jesus again. ([Location 338](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00UF72BAK&location=338))

- But then you start to think there must be more to Christianity, more than just laying your life and sins at the foot of the cross. I came to realize that preachers were telling me to lay my life at the foot of the cross and weren’t giving me anything to pick up. ([Location 381](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00UF72BAK&location=381))
- I developed the spiritual form of it where I did my devotions, read all the new Christian books and saw the Christian movies, and then vomited information up to friends, small groups, and pastors. But it had never had the chance to digest. I had gorged myself on all the products of the Christian industrial complex but was spiritually starving to death. I was marked by an over-consumptive but malnourished spirituality, suffocated by Christianity but thirsty for God. ([Location 400](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00UF72BAK&location=400))
- I long for those who believe in prayer to join forces with those who believe in action. I’ve seen both work miracles. ([Location 461](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00UF72BAK&location=461))
- The only problem with many of the street-corner preachers I’ve heard is that most of the things they say don’t sound like the “good news.” I like their zeal, but not always their message. ([Location 468](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00UF72BAK&location=468))
- Perhaps the devil is just as likely to wear a three-piece suit as to have horns and a pitchfork. ([Location 539](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00UF72BAK&location=539))

- And perhaps the angels look more like the bums in the alley than like feathered white babies. ([Location 540](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00UF72BAK&location=540))
- I thought to myself, I guess God can use the mafia, but I would like God to use the church. ([Location 674](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00UF72BAK&location=674))
- Over and over, when I ask God why all of these injustices are allowed to exist in the world, I can feel the Spirit whisper to me, “You tell me why we allow this to happen. You are my body, my hands, my feet.” ([Location 687](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00UF72BAK&location=687))
- for some strange reason, God doesn’t want to change the world without us. There are times when we throw our hands up at God and say, “Do something!” and if we listen closely, we can hear God respond, “I did do something. I made you.” ([Location 721](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00UF72BAK&location=721))
- So next time you ask God to move a mountain, don’t be surprised if God hands you a shovel. This is a divine conspiracy. We get to be a part of the action. ([Location 725](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00UF72BAK&location=725))
- From my desk at college, it looked like some time back we had stopped living Christianity and just started studying it. ([Location 738](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00UF72BAK&location=738))

- What if Jesus meant the stuff he said? ([Location 748](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00UF72BAK&location=748))
- As Mother Teresa would say (telling the old story about throwing starfish back into the ocean even though they continue to line the beach in thousands), “We are called not to be successful but to be faithful.” That sounds good, but it was the beginning of my years of struggling with the tension between efficiency and faithfulness. ([Location 812](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00UF72BAK&location=812))
- While the temptation to do great things is always before us, in Khalighat I learned the discipline of doing small things with great deliberation. ([Location 816](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00UF72BAK&location=816))
- Mother Teresa used to say, “We can do no great things, just small things with great love. It is not how much you do, but how much love you put into doing it.” ([Location 817](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00UF72BAK&location=817))
- Everything is redeemable, and God is found in unlikely places. ([Location 844](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00UF72BAK&location=844))
- We shall do even greater things because the love that lived in the radical Christ now lives within millions of ordinary radicals all over the planet. ([Location 899](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00UF72BAK&location=899))
- I have come to believe that when we live in a way that requires miracles, we will start to see them. ([Location 910](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00UF72BAK&location=910))
- One of my goals is to live in a way that invites and expects the miraculous. And most of the miracles I’ve seen have been in those all-too-few moments when I stepped out into a space of utter reliance on God. ([Location 911](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00UF72BAK&location=911))
- Imagine what would happen if the prayer movement and social justice movement converged, and we had Christians who prayed like they depend on God and lived like God depended on them? Hallelujah. That would be a miracle, and I’m ready to see it. ([Location 917](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00UF72BAK&location=917))
- They had not chosen to live in “intentional community.” Their survival demanded community. ([Location 932](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00UF72BAK&location=932))
- We had some good times together, including a debate we hosted (okay, rigged) for all of the ROTC cadets in which we “debated” just-war theory and surprisingly came out agreeing that when Jesus said, “Love your enemies,” he meant not to kill them. ([Location 1015](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00UF72BAK&location=1015))
- Rich stood up in chapel and said, “You guys are all into that born again thing, which is great. We do need to be born again, since Jesus said that to a guy named Nicodemus. But if you tell me I have to be born again to enter the kingdom of God, I can tell you that you have to sell everything you have and give it to the poor, because Jesus said that to one guy too . . . [And he paused in the awkward silence.] But I guess that’s why God invented highlighters, so we can highlight the parts we like and ignore the rest.” ([Location 1051](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00UF72BAK&location=1051))
- I was working in one of the wealthiest congregations in the world and performing a play at the Harvard of Christian schools about the life of a little fool named Francis (which people would pay fifteen dollars to see). Define irony. ([Location 1065](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00UF72BAK&location=1065))
- I think it broke Jesus’ heart to let the man walk away. The text says that Jesus looks at him and “loves him” as he walks away. But Jesus doesn’t run after the man saying, “Hey, it’s a journey, just give half,” or, “Start with 10 percent.” He simply lets the man choose his wealth. ([Location 1107](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00UF72BAK&location=1107))
- In our culture of “seeker sensitivity” and radical inclusivity, the great temptation is to compromise the cost of discipleship in order to draw a larger crowd. ([Location 1110](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00UF72BAK&location=1110))
- I long for people to fall in love with God and each other, and so I’m a big fan of being radically inclusive, whether that means not turning off transsexuals or folks who drive SUVs. But I also became aware of how delicate that venture can prove to be. The temptation we face is to compromise the cost of discipleship, and in the process, the Christian identity can get lost. ([Location 1120](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00UF72BAK&location=1120))
- but we would end up with the sort of Christianity that arose after Constantine, in which everyone can be a Christian but no one knows what a Christian is anymore. ([Location 1131](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00UF72BAK&location=1131))
- We can admire and worship Jesus without doing what he did. We can applaud what he preached and stood for without caring about the same things. We can adore his cross without taking up ours. ([Location 1218](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00UF72BAK&location=1218))
- Few people are interested in a religion that has nothing to say to the world and offers them only life after death, when what people are really wondering is whether there is life before death. ([Location 1250](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00UF72BAK&location=1250))

- I am convinced that Jesus came not just to prepare us to die but to teach us how to live. Otherwise, much of Jesus’ wisdom would prove quite unnecessary for the afterlife. ([Location 1255](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00UF72BAK&location=1255))
- Jesus says the kingdom is “within us,” “among us,” “at hand,” and we are to pray that it comes “on earth as it is in heaven.” ([Location 1264](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00UF72BAK&location=1264))
- What gave the early Christians integrity was the fact that they could denounce the empire and in the same breath say, “And we have another way of living. If you are tired of what the empire has to offer, we invite you into the Way.” ([Location 1266](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00UF72BAK&location=1266))

- We narrowed our vision to this: love God, love people, and follow Jesus. ([Location 1307](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00UF72BAK&location=1307))
- Definitely one of my favorite days was seeing a cop use his billy club for wiffle ball—exactly what billy clubs should be used for. ([Location 1347](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00UF72BAK&location=1347))
- The early Christians spoke about resurrection not just as a one-time event two thousand years ago but as something we are invited to participate in. So every time we bring dead space back to life or make ugly things beautiful, it is the work of Jesus. ([Location 1353](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00UF72BAK&location=1353))

- If you know you are going to encounter some ugly stuff, it’s important to surround yourself with beauty. ([Location 1359](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00UF72BAK&location=1359))
- Instead of violence, we learn imagination and sharing. ([Location 1360](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00UF72BAK&location=1360))
- Sometimes we speak to change the world; other times we speak to keep the world from changing us. ([Location 1370](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00UF72BAK&location=1370))
- We spend our lives actively resisting everything that destroys life, whether that be terrorism or the war on terrorism. ([Location 1378](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00UF72BAK&location=1378))

- We believe in another way of life—the kingdom of God—which stands in opposition to the principalities, powers, and rulers of this dark world (Eph. 6:12).3 ([Location 1379](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00UF72BAK&location=1379))
- The truth is that there is a lot of noise out there drowning out quiet voices, and many people have stopped listening to the cries of their neighbors. ([Location 1434](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00UF72BAK&location=1434))
- When folks don’t feel heard, they shout louder. And if we still don’t listen, we make the world a very fragile place. ([Location 1441](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00UF72BAK&location=1441))
- Hallelujah for missional medicine! There are lawyers who bail us out of jail, advocate for human rights, and go with us before zoning boards that have no categories for understanding how we live. ([Location 1561](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00UF72BAK&location=1561))
- It makes you think we need to think of missions not just as a bunch of people who go to a foreign land but folks who ask how they can use their gifts right here at home. ([Location 1564](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00UF72BAK&location=1564))
- And I would add there are many Christians who are not fulfilled in their spiritual lives because they have no sense of their gifts or purpose, and they just run to the mission field to save souls rather than transform lives and communities using their gifts and those of the people they live among. Both lead to emptiness and burnout. ([Location 1578](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00UF72BAK&location=1578))
- Some may leave their jobs. Others will redefine them. ([Location 1601](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00UF72BAK&location=1601))
- The real question is not what are you going to do when you grow up but who are you becoming. ([Location 1606](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00UF72BAK&location=1606))
- “The professions and trades of those who are going to be accepted into the community must be examined. The nature and type of each must be established . . . brothel, sculptors of idols, charioteer, athlete, gladiator . . . give it up or be rejected. A military constable must be forbidden to kill, neither may he swear; if he is not willing to follow these instructions, he must be rejected. A proconsul or magistrate who wears the purple and governs by the sword shall give it up or be rejected. Anyone taking or already baptized who wants to become a soldier shall be sent away, for he has despised God.” ([Location 1607](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00UF72BAK&location=1607))
- Traditional thinking about mission and missionary tends to assume that we are taking God to a godless people or a godless place. But God is everywhere, always ahead of us. So missions is more about recognizing where God is at work and joining in. ([Location 1659](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00UF72BAK&location=1659))
- If all I did was feed people each week, I’d start to grow weary if I wasn’t doing something to address why people are hungry. ([Location 1775](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00UF72BAK&location=1775))
- Too often, the church has chaplained the corporate global economy, caring for the victims of the systems. As long as we uncritically manage the collateral damage of the market economy, the world can continue to produce victims. ([Location 1780](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00UF72BAK&location=1780))
- We close the factories down (we have seven hundred abandoned factories in Philly), and people will have no work, and many inevitably will turn to crime or replacement industries like drugs or prostitution or underground markets. Then we’ll lock them up and open the factories back up as prisons and hire them to do the jobs they could have had before, but now we can pay them a dollar a day. ([Location 1811](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00UF72BAK&location=1811))
- When we are trying to teach kids not to hit each other and they see a government use violence to bring about change, we start to consider what it means to give witness to a peace that is not like the world gives ([Location 1815](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00UF72BAK&location=1815))
- Charity can be a dangerous insulator. ([Location 1915](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00UF72BAK&location=1915))
- I’m just not convinced that Jesus is going to say, “When I was hungry, you gave a check to the United Way and they fed me,” or, “When I was naked, you donated clothes to the Salvation Army and they clothed me.” Jesus is not seeking distant acts of charity. He seeks concrete acts of love: “you fed me . . . you visited me in prison . . . you welcomed me into your home . . . you clothed me.” ([Location 1920](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00UF72BAK&location=1920))
- Faith-based nonprofits can too easily be the mirror image of secular organizations, maintaining the same hierarchies of power and separation between rich and poor. They can too easily merely facilitate the exchange of goods and services, putting plenty of professionals in the middle to guarantee that the rich do not have to face the poor and that power does not shift. Rich and poor are kept in separate worlds, and inequality is carefully managed but not dismantled. ([Location 1929](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00UF72BAK&location=1929))
- That reign did not spread through organizational establishments or structural systems. It spread like disease—through touch, through breath, through life. It spread through people infected by love. ([Location 1937](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00UF72BAK&location=1937))
- we study the Scriptures, we see how many texts we have misread, contextualized, and exegeted to hear what we want to. Like this one about the poor being among us, which Jesus says in the home of a leper and after a poor marginalized woman anoints his feet with perfume. The poor were all around him. Far from saying in defeat that we should not worry about the poor, since they will always be among us, Jesus is pointing the church to her true identity—she is to live close to those who suffer. The poor will always be among us, because the empire will always produce poor people, and they will find a home in the church, a citizenship in the kingdom of God, where the “hungry are filled with good things and the rich sent away empty.” ([Location 1956](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00UF72BAK&location=1956))

- It takes a lot of money or land to “tread lightly on the earth.” My neighbors don’t eat organic; most of them can’t afford to shop at the trendy natural foods stores (if there were one anywhere near us). ([Location 1977](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00UF72BAK&location=1977))
- Simplicity is meaningful only inasmuch as it is grounded in love, authentic relationships, and interdependence. ([Location 1993](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00UF72BAK&location=1993))

- True fasting is not just depriving ourselves of privilege but also sharing sacrificially to bring an end to the cycles of inequality, an end to creation’s groaning and the groaning of hungry bellies. ([Location 2061](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00UF72BAK&location=2061))

- So rather than distancing ourselves from religious language and biblical study, let’s dive into the Scriptures together, correcting bad theology with good theology, correcting distorted understandings of the warrior God by internalizing our allegiance to the slaughtered Lamb, correcting the health-and-wealth gospel by following the Homeless Rabbi.

- the multiplication is not just in the age to come—streets of gold, mansions in heaven, Cadillacs, and crowns. The multiplication of resources begins “in this present age.” ([Location 2141](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00UF72BAK&location=2141))

- It conflicts my spirit to take assistance from the government when I believe it is the primary responsibility of the new community to care for one another. A few years ago, I came across a collective of thousands of Christians who pool their money each month in order to cover one another’s medical bills. This feels much more in harmony with the spirit of the early church, the sense of being a big family with a parent with a big wallet. So I am now a part of that community, and each month I get a letter telling me who’s in the hospital, where my money is going, and how to pray for my sisters and brothers. Over and over, I have seen the divine multiplication meeting people’s needs. ([Location 2177](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00UF72BAK&location=2177))
- Any time we have heard disturbing news about who is making our clothes, we’ve tried to respond, and not all in the same ways. One friend is working toward a global living wage, translating what it costs to live in different areas of the world, and trying to ensure that corporations are paying wages that will allow people to live. Some folks respond to oppression by shopping in thrift stores so that companies rarely see our money; more likely it goes to a family or a charity like the Salvation Army. Other folks cover up brand names so we don’t advertise unless we know that what we advertise incarnates the values of the kingdom. Some of us make our own clothes. In addition to hitting the streets in protest, we can point people to alternatives that are more life-giving, fun, and sustainable.

- As one of the early Christians said, “Starve Mammon with your love.” I hope Mammon goes hungry around here. ([Location 2226](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00UF72BAK&location=2226))
- A lot of things like credit unions and insurance collectives started with a similar vision of sharing money, bearing each other’s burdens, and collectively resisting the drive for individual profit and the isolating loneliness inherent in that. The common good is a wondrous idea. But it’s always a challenge to love our neighbors as ourselves and to seek the common good as much as our own good.

- There are so many experiments in community living and hospitality in different economic and social contexts that the best I can do is give you glimpses of them. ([Location 2249](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00UF72BAK&location=2249))

- Another thing about coins, it was said that you could tell the expanse of an empire by how far the emperor’s coins reached. What if that’s God’s plan in commanding us to “fill the earth, and reproduce like the locusts,” that we carry God’s image with us everywhere we go, to the ends of the earth, and anytime a life is lost, we lose part of God’s image in the world? ([Location 2282](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00UF72BAK&location=2282))
- Once we’ve given to God what’s God’s, there’s not much left for Caesar. ([Location 2293](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00UF72BAK&location=2293))

- For the flag and the cross are both spiritual. And they are both political. It is a dangerous day when we can take the cross out of the church more easily than the flag. No wonder it is hard for seekers to find God nowadays. It’s difficult to know where Christianity ends and America begins.

- Anything involving humans living together purposefully is political, a polis. As the people of God, we are building a new society in the shell of the old, a new polis, the New Jerusalem, the city of God. This is essentially a political act. Without a doubt, envisioning the radical countercultural values of God’s kingdom is by its essence political. Imagine the Gospels with every mention of king, kingdom, Lord, Savior, crowns, banners, and thrones (all words from the imperial lexicon) all edited out. A gospel that is not political is no gospel at all. The root of the word allegiance means “Lord”; that’s exactly what the early Christians were executed for, for pledging an allegiance to another kingdom, another Lord—treason.

- It was precisely his faithlessness to Rome and his faithfulness to Jesus for which John, the writer of Revelation, was persecuted and exiled by Emperor Domitian. It’s not surprising that the early Christians were labeled by imperial officials as “the faithless.” Over and over, early Christian writings tell us of how Christians were branded atheists by the imperial courts and executed for this capital crime. They had lost all faith in the empire and had become faithful to God alone as the one who could preserve peace and prosperity. They claimed Jesus as their only emperor (Acts 17:7), they preached the kingdom of their God, and they pledged allegiance to the slaughtered Lamb.

- It blows your mind to see how consistently the earliest Christians stood on the side of life, and against the taking of life in every way—abortion, capital punishment, violence in all forms. None of them ever condoned killing in any form, even in war. There was a small debate about whether a Christian could serve in the military if they refused to kill (keep in mind in ancient Rome the military was not just a war machine but it was also how bridges and roads were built, making it much more conceivable that you could be in the military in a noncombat role).

We all would like to rid the world of evil (and have gardens free of weeds), which is probably why all the talk of good and evil is so attractive. But the problem, says Jesus, is that if we try to pull up the weeds from the garden, we will rip the wheat up too. In Matthew 13:24–30, he gives a firm command to let the wheat and the weeds grow together, and to let God sort them out at the harvest.

- Growing up, I was told that good people go to church. And then I looked around and watched the news and found a church full of sick people and a world that had some decent pagans. And I studied sociology. My studies taught me that the higher a person’s frequency of church attendance, the more likely they are to be sexist, racist, anti-gay, pro-military, and committed to their local church. And I figured if that’s what it means to be a Christian, I wasn’t sure I wanted to be one, or whether even Jesus would want to be one, for that matter. I wondered why Jesus didn’t take back his religion. As I’ve heard my old mentor Tony Campolo say, “If we were to set out to establish a religion in polar opposition to the Beatitudes Jesus taught, it would look strikingly similar to the pop Christianity that has taken over the airwaves of North America.” ([Location 3428](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00UF72BAK&location=3428))

We are tempted to do great things like rappel from the rafters in the newest church gym or throw the best pizza party so that kids might bow before the altar.

Just because the church is God’s primary instrument for the kingdom doesn’t mean God is not at work in others.

- There are certainly times I am scared, but they aren’t always when I expect to be scared. One of the scariest moments in our community was when the police raided our house (on “accident”) and the SWAT team threw everyone on the floor and ripped one of the women’s shirts. Those are moments when you think, “Who do we call now?!” ([Location 4796](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00UF72BAK&location=4796))
- Now, rather than asking what God’s will is for my life, I find it helpful instead to ask what God’s will is and how my life might fit into that. Maybe that’s what it means to seek first the kingdom of God—the world does not revolve around us, but rather we are revolving around God.

- The real question is not, Do we engage? but rather, How do we engage? If we are to love our neighbors as ourselves, then we care about legislation and laws and policies, because they affect people we are trying to love.

- Every time Christians proclaimed, “Jesus is Lord,” they were also saying, “Caesar is not.” It was deeply and subversively political. It was as strange to say, “Jesus is my Lord,” two thousand years ago as it would be to declare him commander-in-chief today.

- Too often we focus on sex—sexual identity, sexual behavior, sexual attraction—and we forget to talk about love. The starting point must be that the church is a place where everyone can feel loved by God and by people, and then the other stuff gets a little easier, or at least a little safer.

- But I would not dishonor Christ, and my wife, by trying to destroy the life of another person, especially a person who evidently is very much in need of grace. My wife would not want me to kill for her. Nor would I want her to kill for me. ([Location 4895](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00UF72BAK&location=4895))
- We have created a church of believers, not disciples. But let us remember that the Great Commission sends us into the world not just to make believers but to form disciples. So let’s rediscover the practice of disciple-making. That’s what Christians are meant to be—people who remind the world of Jesus. ([Location 4943](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00UF72BAK&location=4943))
- Another way to think of political engagement, or voting, is that we are doing damage control. We are limiting the collateral damage of the principalities and powers. ([Location 4970](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00UF72BAK&location=4970))

- the martyrs were known for their faithfulness to God over Caesar. One of the early Christians said that every time a Christian proclaimed, “Jesus is Lord,” they were saying, “Caesar is not.” The early Christians were known to be rebels and revolutionaries, albeit in a very different kind of revolution, a revolution that was as much for the freedom of the oppressors as for the freedom of the oppressed, a nonviolent revolution marked by enemy-love, gentleness, and audacious grace. But it was a revolution nonetheless. “These men who have caused trouble all over the world have now come here. . . . They are all defying Caesar’s decrees, saying that there is another king, one called Jesus” (Acts 17:6–7). We see this holy mischief all the way through the Bible, even to the book of Revelation, where John, the writer of Revelation, gets exiled.
