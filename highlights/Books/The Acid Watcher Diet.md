## Highlights
- Dietary acid is in many of the most commonly consumed foods and drinks, even though you probably don’t know it’s there. It’s in canned and jarred soups and vegetables especially if they’ve been pickled, marinated, or fermented. It is in all carbonated beverages and industrially produced fruit juices. It’s present in every product that contains high-fructose corn syrup, even in items that don’t seem to be sweet at all. This ubiquitous and overused sweetener is produced using sulfuric acid and you’ll find it in the most unexpected places, such as in condiments, barbecue sauces, cocktail sauces, spice mixes, even baby food. ([Location 246](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01EE0FA9W&location=246))
- First, it identifies food items that are considered healthy by general nutritional standards but are nevertheless extremely harmful to individuals with acid reflux—for example, wine, citrus fruits, raw garlic, raw onion, and tomato. ([Location 279](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01EE0FA9W&location=279))
- Foods that promote indigestion and acidification will be eliminated, including carbonated beverages, alcohol, caffeine, chocolate, mint, and raw onion and garlic. ([Location 297](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01EE0FA9W&location=297))
- It’s important to keep in mind, however, that 28 days is the minimum amount of time needed for healing tissues that have been exposed to years, decades, and even a lifetime of acid damage. You will typically begin to feel better early on, with symptoms of indigestion and heartburn and throat clearing beginning to subside in a matter of 21 days (depending on severity), but this is simply evidence that the diet is working, not that it should be over. ([Location 304](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01EE0FA9W&location=304))
- Engaging in exercise that emphasizes stretching, balance, and healing can help neutralize acid damage and promote weight loss—the latter is especially powerful since a 10 percent reduction in weight (if you are overweight or obese) can significantly ease acid-related symptoms. ([Location 324](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01EE0FA9W&location=324))
- Research has revealed that poor sleep quality and/or insufficient sleep and chronic stress have a direct relationship to weight gain and acid damage. ([Location 326](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01EE0FA9W&location=326))
- The biggest culprits in the loosening of the LES are the following:
  • tobacco
  • caffeine
  • chocolate
  • carbonated sugary drinks
  • alcohol
  These all contribute to the opening of the door for corrosive gastric acid to reflux from the stomach up into the esophagus. ([Location 379](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01EE0FA9W&location=379))
- The UES is also susceptible to damage from tobacco and alcohol, and a loss of tension here will allow acid into the upper respiratory organs such as the mouth, larynx, and trachea. Acid in these regions can lead to symptoms that are usually associated with acid reflux, such as the following: • hoarseness • phlegm • postnasal drip • asthma • shortness of breath ([Location 385](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01EE0FA9W&location=385))
- With a pH of around 2.5, soda is the most acidic and corrosive substance we consume ([Location 491](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01EE0FA9W&location=491))
- When you consume soda, it contributes to acid damage in two ways. First, the intense acidity of the liquid begins to erode your esophageal lining, causing acute damage to the lower esophageal sphincter, which you’ll remember has the important job of locking out gastric acid housed in the stomach below. Secondary to the direct acid-caused damage is the effect of carbonation found in sodas. Carbonation amplifies the corrosive quality of soda and works against your acid protection system by increasing pressure in the stomach. As this pressure increases, gastric acid can get refluxed up toward the LES. And since the LES has just been damaged by the downflow of acidic soda, it’s essentially been primed to allow for refluxed acid to find its way up onto the tissues of your esophagus. From an Acid Watcher’s perspective, soda is enemy number one. ([Location 494](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01EE0FA9W&location=494))
- What’s the problem with HFCS? First of all, it has sulfuric acid in it, which is an extremely acidic substance. Furthermore, the chemicals used in the processing of HFCS have the side effect of loosening the LES. ([Location 510](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01EE0FA9W&location=510))
- Even just a small amount of sulfuric acid exposure each day could lead to significant esophageal damage over time, paving the way for more serious acid-related issues to develop. ([Location 516](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01EE0FA9W&location=516))
- The Acid Watcher Diet is about keeping your dietary acid and your inflammation low. Poor dietary choices and inflammation always go hand in hand. ([Location 539](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01EE0FA9W&location=539))
- There are two steps to taking a PPI the correct way: 1. Take a PPI dose thirty to sixty minutes before you eat either breakfast or dinner, or both (allowing it to enter your bloodstream). 2. Eat something to “activate” the PPI within thirty to sixty minutes after taking the medication. ([Location 1094](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01EE0FA9W&location=1094))
- So if you are an Acid Watcher, I recommend staying away from red meat—but not from all animal-derived proteins. ([Location 1173](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01EE0FA9W&location=1173))
- Animal-derived proteins that are good for Acid Watchers include sardines, salmon, tuna, halibut, turkey (light meat, no skin), chicken (light meat, no skin), yogurt, kefir, and eggs. ([Location 1175](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01EE0FA9W&location=1175))
- Examples of vegetable-derived proteins include peanuts, oatmeal, cashews, beans (all types), tofu, edamame, walnuts, soy milk (non–genetically modified), hazelnuts, whole grains, quinoa, broccoli, spinach, kale, and spirulina. ([Location 1178](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01EE0FA9W&location=1178))
- Beans and eggs, especially egg yolks, can be hard for some people to digest. I recommend that they be consumed in moderation. ([Location 1190](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01EE0FA9W&location=1190))
- For best results, animal sources of protein should primarily be eaten in combination with vegetables, ideally prepared raw or steamed, for easier digestion. ([Location 1191](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01EE0FA9W&location=1191))
- Here are natural sources of common complex (good) carbohydrates: Vegetables: Broccoli, cucumber, cauliflower, spinach, potatoes, corn, carrots, lettuce Whole grains: Brown rice, oats, whole-grain cereal, whole-wheat pasta, whole-wheat bread, whole-grain bread Legumes: Beans (all kinds) Fruit: Apricots, apples, pears, prunes, oranges, grapefruit, plums Dairy: Milk, cheese, yogurt (in limited amounts) ([Location 1210](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01EE0FA9W&location=1210))
- oranges, grapefruit, and prunes—are extremely acidic and should be avoided by people with acid reflux. ([Location 1220](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01EE0FA9W&location=1220))
- Many fruits such as bananas, mangoes, pomegranates, and raisins contain naturally occurring simple carbs, but that doesn’t mean they should be avoided. They contain fiber and a wide variety of vitamins and minerals that your body needs. ([Location 1247](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01EE0FA9W&location=1247))
- Berries and citrus—while micronutrient rich—are too acidic for people with acid damage. ([Location 1256](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01EE0FA9W&location=1256))
- trans fat loosens the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) so stomach acid can freely splash back up into the esophagus. ([Location 1293](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01EE0FA9W&location=1293))
- If you don’t have access to organic animal products, try to replace them with fats found in plants (avocado, coconut, olives, nuts, seeds), or the healthy fats found in fish, discussed in the following sections. ([Location 1302](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01EE0FA9W&location=1302))
- do not allow more than 10 percent of your daily fat intake to come from saturated fat. ([Location 1306](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01EE0FA9W&location=1306))
- the Acid Watcher Diet calls for you to eat either a vegetarian lunch or dinner every day. ([Location 1307](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01EE0FA9W&location=1307))
- With the exception of red meat, monounsaturated fats are typically good choices for people with acid reflux disease. ([Location 1314](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01EE0FA9W&location=1314))
- a subset of monounsaturated fat is not good for those with acid reflux—vegetable oils made from seeds. Examples include soybean oil, corn oil, canola oil, safflower oil, cottonseed oil, grapeseed oil, and sunflower oil. ([Location 1315](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01EE0FA9W&location=1315))
- Cold-pressed vegetable oils are always the best option for people with acid reflux. If possible, choose extra virgin olive oil, ([Location 1319](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01EE0FA9W&location=1319))
- The best sources of monounsaturated fat for people with acid reflux are the following:
  Cold-pressed extra virgin olive oil Avocado and avocado oil
  Coconut oil
  Cashews
  Almonds
  Peanuts ([Location 1322](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01EE0FA9W&location=1322))
- Omega-3 is produced in the leafy parts of the plant during photosynthesis. Omega-6 is produced predominantly in the seeds of plants. Animals acquire the largest amount of omega-3 fats by directly consuming leafy plants or grass. That is why meat or eggs from grass-fed animals will have more omega-3 than from grain-fed animals. ([Location 1332](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01EE0FA9W&location=1332))
- Just as with land animals allowed to run free and eat grass for their sustenance, wild fish are richer in omega-3 than farmed fish. In addition, cold-water fish have the highest amount of omega-3 because their natural habitat promotes the best conditions for the accumulation of this type of fat in their bodies. ([Location 1336](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01EE0FA9W&location=1336))
- remove processed and deep-fried foods from your diet. ([Location 1346](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01EE0FA9W&location=1346))
- increase your fish intake to at least twice a week and eat plenty of vegetables so your body will find a natural balance between omega-6 and omega-3 fat. ([Location 1347](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01EE0FA9W&location=1347))
- Here are some healthy polyunsaturated fats:
  Omega-3-Rich Foods
  Salmon
  Sardine
  Kale
  Anchovies
  Halibut
  Seaweed
  Herring
  Tuna
  Flaxseed
  Mackerel
  Eggs (from grass-fed chickens)
  Walnuts
  Trout
  Spinach
  Marine algae
  Omega-6-Rich Foods
  Sunflower seeds
  Eggs
  Pecans
  Pumpkin seeds
  Avocados
  Cashews
  Poultry
  Walnuts ([Location 1348](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01EE0FA9W&location=1348))
- Even cooking some plant-based foods—such as broccoli and zucchini—can strip them of certain antioxidants, such as vitamin C. ([Location 1382](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01EE0FA9W&location=1382))
- most whole fruits, vegetables, nuts, and seeds contain both insoluble and soluble fiber. ([Location 1421](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01EE0FA9W&location=1421))
- Dietary fiber indirectly and directly helps diminish levels of inflammation. ([Location 1489](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01EE0FA9W&location=1489))
- And the #1 benefit of increased fiber consumption for Acid Watchers… 1. Reduced risk of Barrett’s esophagus and esophageal cancer: ([Location 1506](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01EE0FA9W&location=1506))
- As an Acid Watcher, increasing your fiber intake will be second only to eliminating acidic foods. ([Location 1516](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01EE0FA9W&location=1516))
- Eat a daily minimum of 1 pound of vegetables above pH 5, half of which should be consumed raw ([Location 1520](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01EE0FA9W&location=1520))
- To eat 1 pound of vegetables each day, ½ pound of which is cooked and ½ pound of which is eaten raw, you will need to consume about the equivalent of two cups of vegetables (measured when raw). ([Location 1525](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01EE0FA9W&location=1525))
- Some vegetables, such as carrots, asparagus, cabbage, mushrooms, and spinach, offer a greater concentration of antioxidants when cooked compared to when eaten raw (if they’re prepared by steaming or boiling, that is). ([Location 1527](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01EE0FA9W&location=1527))
- Broccoli is one nutritional powerhouse that you should try to eat raw, ([Location 1530](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01EE0FA9W&location=1530))
- Eat a daily minimum of ½ pound of raw fruit, above pH 5 ([Location 1538](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01EE0FA9W&location=1538))
- Approximately one cup of chopped or sliced fruit or one medium-sized piece of handheld fruit is equal to ½ pound and will satisfy your fruit serving for the day. ([Location 1541](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01EE0FA9W&location=1541))
- You won’t have to worry about tracking your fiber intake; simply meet the daily fruit and vegetable minimums and you will be covered. ([Location 1545](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01EE0FA9W&location=1545))
- The absence of tomatoes, onions, garlic, vinegar, and citrus foods from the Healing Phase is essential for the acid-damaged esophageal and throat tissue to be healed. ([Location 1670](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01EE0FA9W&location=1670))
- Devising a customized strategy for stress reduction, sleep improvement, and exercise is another key step. ([Location 1747](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01EE0FA9W&location=1747))
- 100 percent of smokers have acid reflux disease. ([Location 1797](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01EE0FA9W&location=1797))
- Once stimulated, the receptors in the brain not only help produce the high one experiences but also relax the reflexes that protect us from aspiration and acid regurgitation. ([Location 1832](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01EE0FA9W&location=1832))
- alcohol stimulates gastrin—a hormone that triggers the production of gastric acid—and acid secretion in the stomach. Just like it slows down your reflexes and loosens your tongue, alcohol also delays gastric acid emptying in your digestive tract. It relaxes the lower esophageal sphincter, allowing the acid to travel into places where it doesn’t belong. ([Location 1847](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01EE0FA9W&location=1847))
- the process of carbonation does two things: First, it slightly reduces the pH of any beverage, thereby making it a more acidic and aggressive pepsin stimulant. Your entire gastrointestinal tract feels the pain and the inflammation surge with every sip you take. Second, the gas bubbles in carbonated beverages distend the stomach almost two to one over noncarbonated beverages. ([Location 1878](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01EE0FA9W&location=1878))
- Acid Watchers have to remember that some natural foods have been processed and thus become more dangerous for them. These are vinegar and fruits, vegetables, and animal-source protein that have been subject to pickling, jarring, fermentation, and preserving. Some of these ancient methods of food preparation and preservation have been rediscovered and reinvented by artisanal makers and creative home cooks, and can produce some delicious outcomes. ([Location 1909](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01EE0FA9W&location=1909))
- Cortisol is a hunger stimulant, which is why so many people eat when they are stressed. Worse, when you experience chronic stress you are more likely to have trouble falling asleep or staying asleep. ([Location 1969](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01EE0FA9W&location=1969))
- Studies have shown that when we perform work that requires mental strain as opposed to physical strain, we tend to excrete more stress hormones such as cortisol that trick us into thinking we are hungry when we are not. ([Location 1980](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01EE0FA9W&location=1980))
- Reduced sleep upregulates ghrelin, an appetite-stimulating hormone, and downregulates leptin, a hormone responsible for the sensation of satiety. ([Location 1988](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01EE0FA9W&location=1988))
- Mint: This is a powerful carminative and the Acid Watcher restriction applies to the herb itself, its variation as a spice, and flavored chewing gum. ([Location 2083](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01EE0FA9W&location=2083))
- Drop processed food: ([Location 2102](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01EE0FA9W&location=2102))
    - Tags: [[health]] 
- I allow three exceptions in the Acid Watcher Diet: canned tuna, chickpeas, and beans. Canned tuna must be water packed and drained before using. Canned chickpeas and beans must be organic and thoroughly washed to eliminate traces of acidified liquids. ([Location 2104](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01EE0FA9W&location=2104))
- Forget fried foods: ([Location 2106](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01EE0FA9W&location=2106))
- 7:00 a.m.–9:00 a.m. Breakfast 10:00 a.m.–11:00 a.m. Midmorning mini-meal 12:30 p.m.–2:00 p.m. Lunch 3:00 p.m.–4:00 p.m. Midafternoon mini-meal 6:00 p.m.–7:30 p.m. Dinner ([Location 2123](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01EE0FA9W&location=2123))
- Fish: salmon, halibut, tilapia, trout, flounder, branzino, and sole
  Poultry: chicken breast, ground turkey, eggs
  Vegetables and herbs: spinach, romaine lettuce, arugula, curly kale, bok choy, broccoli, asparagus, celery, cucumbers, zucchini, eggplant, yellow squash, potato, sweet potato, carrots (not baby carrots), beets (fresh or frozen), cremini mushrooms, basil, cilantro, parsley, rosemary, dried thyme, and sage
  Raw fruit: banana, Bosc pears, papaya, cantaloupe, honeydew, watermelon, lychee, and avocados
  Dried fruit: dates, raisins, shredded coconut
  Nuts and seeds: cashews, pecans, pistachios, walnuts, pumpkin seeds, sesame seeds, almonds, pine nuts
  Spreads: fresh, raw, organic peanut butter and almond butter
  Cheese: Parmesan, mozzarella, feta, and other select hard cheese
  Bread and grains: old-fashioned rolled oats, whole-grain pasta, 100% whole-grain bread, whole-grain wheat flour
  Sweeteners: agave nectar (a borderline pH value food; see this page to learn how to use safely)
  Condiments: Celtic salt, olive and coconut oil, Bragg Liquid Aminos, hemp protein, vanilla extract, white miso paste... ([Location 2141](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01EE0FA9W&location=2141))
- Eat a daily minimum of 1 pound of vegetables above pH 5, half of which should be consumed raw. ([Location 2175](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01EE0FA9W&location=2175))
- Eat a daily minimum of ½ pound of raw fruit, above pH 5. ([Location 2180](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01EE0FA9W&location=2180))
- you must also beware of the following items: Seed oils Peppers Berries Honey Organic agave ([Location 2186](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01EE0FA9W&location=2186))
- Berries are, however, allowed in both phases of the diet if they are balanced by acid neutralizers such as almond milk, non-GMO (genetically modified organism) soy milk, rice milk, and coconut milk. ([Location 2223](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01EE0FA9W&location=2223))
- Eat 100% whole-grain bread. This includes rye, spelt, wheat, barley, and oat. ([Location 2248](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01EE0FA9W&location=2248))
- The only beverage you should consume during the Healing Phase is water. ([Location 2252](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01EE0FA9W&location=2252))
- If you can roast, sauté, grill, poach, and blanch, you can prepare delicious meals with minimal effort. ([Location 2275](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01EE0FA9W&location=2275))
- I found that using a mix of ground fennel, cumin, coriander, celery seeds, and ginger produces flavors just as exceptional, if not more aromatic. ([Location 2285](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01EE0FA9W&location=2285))
- With root vegetables (carrots, beets, butternut squash, sweet potato), a combination of cinnamon, Celtic salt, cumin, and ginger will provide an exotic-flavored side dish that can be served straight out of the oven, at room temperature, or the next day. ([Location 2289](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01EE0FA9W&location=2289))
- You can use cedar skewers for grilling shrimp, scallops, and squid to produce tasty dishes that do not rely on acidic flavorings. ([Location 2326](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01EE0FA9W&location=2326))
- White wine and lemon are traditional poaching liquids, but as Acid Watchers, we can’t rely on these acidic standards. Instead, I recommend a medley of fresh herbs and aromatics in water—fennel fronds, ginger, dill, parsley, and fresh bay leaf, if available—which infuse foods with fresh, organic flavors. ([Location 2331](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01EE0FA9W&location=2331))
- Poaching fruit is one of the easiest and most satisfying methods to prepare Acid Watcher–style desserts. In the Healing Phase, pears and raisins are a great pairing, ([Location 2336](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01EE0FA9W&location=2336))
- The poaching liquid can be flavored with cinnamon, vanilla bean, star anise, and cloves. ([Location 2339](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01EE0FA9W&location=2339))
- In the Healing Phase of the diet, you can use fennel and the Indian spice asafetida in place of onions and garlic. You can use sumac in place of lemon and citrus. And try carob in place of chocolate. You can make your salad dressing creamier with tofu spread or avocado and replace the tang of citrus (or soy sauce, if you like your salads more Asian style) with Bragg Liquid Aminos. Star anise and cloves can spice up your desserts. ([Location 2356](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01EE0FA9W&location=2356))

- A combination of ginger, cumin, and cilantro; or oregano, paprika, and salt; or saffron; or asafetida, which is intense and satisfying enough to make the memories of onion and garlic fade away. ([Location 2532](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01EE0FA9W&location=2532))

- a specific exercise approach can also subdue postmeal acid activity. ([Location 4261](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01EE0FA9W&location=4261))
- prolonged exertion can aggravate and even trigger acid reflux symptoms. ([Location 4271](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01EE0FA9W&location=4271))
- For our purposes, the intensity of the exercise is not as crucial as the regularity with which you pursue it. ([Location 4272](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01EE0FA9W&location=4272))
- DO MAKE YOUR EXERCISE HABIT CONSISTENT ([Location 4275](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01EE0FA9W&location=4275))
- The longer this calories-stored-as-fat cycle continues, the more difficult, thanks to age-related slowing of metabolism, it becomes to burn off accumulated fat tissue. This is why it’s better to exercise off unused calories today than to find them around your waist tomorrow. ([Location 4279](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01EE0FA9W&location=4279))
- The minimum recommended amount is 150 minutes a week of physical activity, which is approximately 21 minutes a day or a little over 40 minutes every other day. ([Location 4285](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01EE0FA9W&location=4285))
- Because exercise has a cumulative effect on metabolism, motivation, and endurance, it’s recommended that you don’t go more than one day without getting in some type of workout. ([Location 4286](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01EE0FA9W&location=4286))
- When you eat and drink, your stomach naturally expands to make room for what you’ve just ingested, which can increase pressure on the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) and lead to a relaxing of this important muscle. ([Location 4298](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01EE0FA9W&location=4298))
- One way to prevent the gastric distention that occurs after you eat from placing too much pressure on the LES is to simply go for a walk after meals. This can minimize the pressure by helping accelerate digestive processes, which will empty the stomach and shrink it back to size at a faster rate. It’s likely because of this effect on digestion that a post-dinner walk has been linked to reduced risk of stomach cancer.

- You can certainly walk after other meals as well if you’d like, but the timing of the nighttime walk is important, as it should also lessen your chances of experiencing nocturnal reflux. ([Location 4306](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01EE0FA9W&location=4306))
- In either position, focus on keeping your spine erect as you place one hand on your chest and one hand just at your beltline. Inhale deeply and slowly through your nose, taking air into your belly (you’ll know you’re doing it right if the hand at your beltline rises). Exhale through your nose, feeling your belly as it sinks back in. Repeat five to ten times, alternating the position of your hands if you’d like. Belly breathing can be practiced at any time of day and can serve as a nice breath of fresh air during your lunch or coffee break.

- Movements that require intense strain of the abdominal wall, which is essentially your core, should be avoided, as should those that require a sustained crouched position and others that repeatedly put your head below your waist.
