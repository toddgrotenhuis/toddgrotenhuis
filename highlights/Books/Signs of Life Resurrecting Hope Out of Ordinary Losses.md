## Highlights
### Introduction
- "The question we have to ask ourselves now is this: Is the resurrection enough? Is the resurrection enough to provide a way forward?" (Page 13)
- I have come to believe and know in the deepest part of my soul that the resurrection *does* have something to say to our ordinary losses, to the deaths that pock our path. The resurrection was not a mere moment in time, a flash-bang act of God to release Jesus and then us from the bonds of hell. The resurrection was a radical breaking into this world by God. Because of the resurrection, the old is passing away and God's New Creation is taking root among us. This Spirit-empowered, resurrection-initiated New Creation is bursting to life in unexpected ways in the world, this broken world with all its hurts big and small, with all its wounds deep and superficial. And this resurrection power not only has something to *say* to the ordinary losses that lie buried in our hearts; it also bears within it a promise for healing and wholeness, both now and in eternity. (Page 15)
- Our story, as disjointed and broken as it may seem, finds a place in God's story as we are invited to participate in God's redemptive work. Even our losses, or perhaps *especially* our losses, are welcomed for they become the means by which God's resurrecting power is made manifest. (Page 16)
### Death of Zeal
- When other young men left formal schooling, Saul continued by studying under a famous rabbi, Gamaliel, in Jerusalem. (Page 23)
    - Note: I forgot about this
- Keep your distance *and* reach out? That's a complex message for teenagers to follow. (Page 25)
- This was what the zealous do: avoid corruption and encourage other people to join the enclave.
  Yet such a contradiction comes at a price. I found myself both the enforcer of legalisms and the enforced. (Page 27)
- I could no longer deny the incongruities: the painful disconnect between isolationism and evangelism, the distance between the claim of Christian community and the mistreatment I so regularly experienced there. I questioned the realities I had once accepted so freely: that to be saved meant ascribing to specific, nonnegotiable beliefs. These included such things as believing in a six-day creation account, adhering to a very specific moral code including but not limited to total abstinence from alcohol, and voting Republican. This code also meant working timelessly to mimic pagan culture's events, technology, and aesthetics so as to attract unbelievers to the the church. (Page 31)
- With zealous, uninformed passion and self-righteousness, we bought into the narrative that the role of the church was to call out the sin of the world and keep our own noses clean. I bought the story that Christians are to avoid being sullied by the world by ministering via a ten-foot ole until the world acts right, and to keep everyone inside the church walking a tight, uniform morality line. These were the signs of faithfulness, the indicators of God's approval and our inclusion in the faith family. (Page 33)
- "...you will never out-MTV MTV," he said, "Do you get that? We have to get out of that game....Our call as the church, and as church leaders, is not to run the hottest show in town, the flashiest, most alluring performance," he said. "Our call isn't to serve as the morality police, spewing condemnation rapid-fire. Our call is to a King and a kingdom." (Page 35)

### Death of Future
- A new vision of the future, in the face of the death of the future we anticipated, comes to us not through the power of positive thinking or through compulsive striving. We cannot muscle our way through to resurrection. We cannot put ourselves in a resurrection state of mind. It comes to us as a divine gift. And it comes to us when we are not our best selves, when we are not on top of our game or climbing the ladder of success and achievement. No. It comes to us when the water has risen up to our neck and we can no longer pretend, when we can no longer feign mastery of our circumstances or power over our destiny. Resurrection of our future comes only when we have honestly acknowledged the death before us, the death of the future we had imagined and attempted to construct for ourselves by sheer force. Resurrection come when we cry out to the God of Hagar, El-roi, the God who sees. (Page 54)
### Death of Plans
- I had taken a class in seminary on Revelation, and I was so eager to give our congregation a glimpse behind all the fearmongering and prediction silliness and into the heart of a book centered on worship of the Lamb that was slaughtered. (Page 70)
    - Note: Amen. I recommend _Apocalypse and Allegiance_ by J. Nelson Kraybill https://bookshop.org/a/10222/9781587432613
- ...proleptic pronouncement, a declaration of hope yet unfulfilled. (Page 71)

- ...every obedience, whether in the courts of the temple or in a church pew in rural Missouri, matters in the kingdom. Every yes [sic] to the Spirit's promptings in our lives, however unexpected or even unwelcome, cracks us open bit by bit, enabling us to respond to the Spirit's direction and to participate in God's redemptive work in and around us. (Page 75)
### Death of Expectations
- Those painful realities [e.g. patriarchal models] are not prescriptive; they are descriptive of what happens when the powers of sin do their work. (Page 82)
- There is no freedom or resurrection power at work in and among us; just a watery salvation that keeps us out of hell but has no redemptive power now. (Page 83)
    - Note: The author is reflecting on the false belief that we should accept a state of sinful disorder as normative.
- I served that first church with every ounce of my being and quickly discovered I would have to earn what had been so freely given to my husband, particularly pastoral authority and even the title of the office. (Page 85)
### Death of Hope
### Death of Revival
- In most contemporary evangelical circles, conversations about sin are more about individual moral failings than corporate, systemic patterns of disobedience. It is easier to identify and regulate personal behaviors, like alcohol consumption and sexual practices, than it is to grasp hold of the slippery eel that is corporate sin. (Page 119)

- All of that is true, of course. God *does* resurrect and restore dead and broken things. But as pastor Brad Roth says in his book on rural churches, *God's Country*, "Resurrection is a promise to the church universal, not to any individual congregation." Laypeople and pastors alike lay claim to resurrection promises as a guarantee that the local church will not--or even perhaps *cannot*--die. Our true craving is not resurrection but *renewal*, and on our terms.
  Resurrection, then, becomes not the unique work of God but a tool of ministry--a long-range church growth plan. It becomes not a mystery but a method. We implement new structures and programs, throwing ourselves endlessly into the work of the church because, as Roth says, "we come to believe that resurrection is a response to *our* faithfulness." In our workhorse, pull-the-church-up-by-its-bootstraps mentality, we believe we can work ourselves into a state of resurrection. Just keep working, just keep praying, just keep serving... (Page 121)
- ...the call is not to forgive and forget, but to forgive every time you remember. (Page 124)

### Death of Beauty
- I need a story that takes seriously the goodness of my body as it is but that is also honest about the genuine disorder within it and around it. (Page 144)
- The resurrected Jesus is raised in the flesh. Transformed flesh, but flesh nonetheless, still bearing the marks of a life lived in the body. Jesus's resurrection in the body--a body with ethnicity, gender, and physical scars--is God's verdict on my body: beloved in beauty. (Page 147)
- I also refuse to claim that our bodies don't matter. I will not perpetuate the church's failed story be repeating it loudly and aggressively in an attempt to make it more true. I will not minimize the brokenness within us and around us, but I also will not buy into or promote the story that tries to convince us that the body is a meaningless shell, a disposable container for the "real me." (Page 148)
### Death of Invincibility
### Death of Image
- I had been spoiled by so many years of near-effortless success. Mistakes, particularly mistakes made in front of others, felt fatal. (Page 172)
    - Note: This was my feeling someway through my first year at nerd university.
