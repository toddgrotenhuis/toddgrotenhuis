## Highlights
### Preface
- In 2018, the marketplace of ideas is sick unto death, close to being replaced by an SEO nightmare populated with the intellectual equivalents of malware, viruses, and banking scams. ([Location 78](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GT9C337&location=78))
### Chapter One: The Internet Is Garbage
- So much of the internet is garbage, and much of its infrastructure and many work hours are devoted to taking out the garbage. ([Location 99](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GT9C337&location=99))
#### A Theory of Garbage
- Garbage is simply undesirable content. ([Location 115](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GT9C337&location=115))
- No matter how libertarian, how permissive, and how illegal a site is, there is always content that is deemed to be unworthy of staying on the site. ([Location 124](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GT9C337&location=124))
- Some content contributes value, other content detracts. Each corner of the internet works actively to discourage or weed out the trash—otherwise the garbage will choke it up and kill it. ([Location 129](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GT9C337&location=129))
#### Spam as Garbage
- Spam ... a multimillion-dollar industry that is combated in turn by billions of dollars in anti-spam technology. ([Location 166](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GT9C337&location=166))
- The deep ambiguity in the word “spam” in the early days echoes how nebulous the word “harassment” is today. ([Location 174](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GT9C337&location=174))
- We are in the early days of understanding “harassment” as a subcategory of garbage. Just like spam used to be a catchall for many different kinds of garbage, harassment, too, has become a catchall. But if we are to fight it, the definition must be improved. ([Location 182](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GT9C337&location=182))
### Chapter Two: On Harassment
#### Harassment in the News
##### Caroline Criado Perez
##### Anita Sarkeesian
##### Amanda Hess
##### Zoë Quinn
- The SJW moniker seems to come from the belief that people who criticize video games for a lack of diversity are the enemy—a kind of cultural juggernaut with a supposed chokehold on the media, which must be forcefully opposed. ([Location 276](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GT9C337&location=276))
- What Gjoni was doing was both complicated and simple, old and new. He had managed to crowdsource domestic abuse. ([Location 294](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GT9C337&location=294))
##### Kathy Sierra
- a consistent pattern is that the harassment ramps up the more you talk about it. And so the worst of what they receive remains hidden from the public eye. ([Location 313](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GT9C337&location=313))
#### About That Media Narrative . . .
- In the media narrative, harassment becomes unruly words, not Social Security numbers. It becomes rape threats, but not the publication of physical addresses. It becomes floods and floods of frightening tweets, not a SWAT team knocking on your door because someone on the internet called the police with a fake threat. ([Location 345](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GT9C337&location=345))
- harassment is still depicted as an ephemeral harm from ghostly entities. But it’s not. It encompasses a vast spectrum that includes intimate partner violence, stalking, invasion of privacy, hacking, and even assault. ([Location 351](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GT9C337&location=351))
#### Is Harassment Gendered?
- In 2006, researchers placed silent bots on Internet Relay Chat. The bots with female names received 25 times more “malicious private messages” (defined as “sexually explicit or threatening language”) than the bots with male names. ([Location 363](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GT9C337&location=363))
#### Intersections of Harassment
- victims are unwilling to report to the police due to the (not unreasonable) perception that their concerns will not be taken seriously. ([Location 389](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GT9C337&location=389))
- teenagers will identify instances of online bullying as “drama”—the term “cyberbullying” fails to “resonate” with them. “Cyberbullying” is a term that adults use. Similarly, it’s possible that the term “online harassment” is one that is more prevalently used by a particular group to describe their experiences, even if other groups are equally impacted by the exact same behavior. ([Location 393](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GT9C337&location=393))
- First, the internet is experienced completely differently by people who are visibly identifiable as a marginalized race or gender. ([Location 420](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GT9C337&location=420))
- What, for example, is the point of prioritizing educating police if the most vulnerable internet users (say, transgender people and/or sex workers and/or people of color) are the least likely to actually call the police? ([Location 423](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GT9C337&location=423))
- A one-size-fits-all approach based on the favored media narrative will certainly have unintended consequences for those whose stories don’t make it into the headlines. ([Location 427](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GT9C337&location=427))
#### On Doxing
- The idea that a “full name” can constitute a dox represents an understanding that in some contexts, the publication of a legal name serves as an incitement to drop a full dox. ([Location 461](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GT9C337&location=461))
- The context in which the publicly information gets posted matters. When the dox is posted “before a pre-existing hostile audience,” the likelihood that malicious action follows from it is much higher. Cross calls it “crowd-sourcing harassment.” ([Location 467](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GT9C337&location=467))
    - Tags: [[definition]] 
- The troll doesn’t have to get his hands dirty knowing someone else will do it for him. ([Location 473](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GT9C337&location=473))
#### SWATting
#### Doxing Women
- Dropping dox is how the internet retaliates against those who threaten it—but it’s not just a substantive retaliation; it is a policing of the internet as a public space. ([Location 510](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GT9C337&location=510))
- Doxing originated as vigilante retaliation by hackers against their perceived enemies. ([Location 519](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GT9C337&location=519))
- Doxing is an intimidation tactic in what its practitioners clearly believe is a war for online spaces. ([Location 522](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GT9C337&location=522))
- Everyone has his own understanding of what does or does not belong on the internet—in other words, what garbage needs to be taken out. In the case of misogynists, women are that garbage. ([Location 523](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GT9C337&location=523))
#### Concluding Thoughts on Doxing
- anonymity is not the problem. ([Location 528](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GT9C337&location=528))
- While the same things that can mitigate abuse in general can also mitigate doxing ... the consequences of doxing cannot be addressed by the same strategies. ([Location 555](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GT9C337&location=555))
#### A Taxonomy of Harassment
- Targets of harassment, particularly members of marginalized groups, may view a single comment differently than an outsider might, because they recognize it as part of a larger pattern. ([Location 564](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GT9C337&location=564))
- When looking at harassment as content, we ultimately fixate on “death threats” as one end of the spectrum, and “annoying messages” at the other end. Thus the debate ends up revolving around civil rights versus free speech... ([Location 568](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GT9C337&location=568))
- Behavior is a better, more useful lens through which to look at harassment.  On one end of the behavioral spectrum of online harassment, we see a drive-by vitriolic message thrown out in the night; on the other end, we see the leaking of Social Security numbers, the publication of private photographs, the sending of SWAT teams to physical addresses, and physical assault. ([Location 571](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GT9C337&location=571))
- Seeing these behaviors on the same spectrum becomes illuminating because it teaches us not how to punish, but how to design environments to make targets feel safe. ([Location 578](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GT9C337&location=578))
- Harassing content and harassing behavior of course overlap. Internet postings are both content and behavior. But changing the lens can completely change your understanding. ([Location 580](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GT9C337&location=580))
- Harassing content can be divided right along its spectrum from least extreme to most extreme: ...
  Sub-Threatening Harassment. Harassment that cannot be construed as a threat. ...
  Colorably Threatening Harassment. Harassment that is not overtly threatening, but is either ambiguously threatening such that an objective observer might have a hard time deciding, or is clearly intended to make the target fearful while maintaining plausible deniability. ...
  Overtly Threatening Harassment. ([Location 584](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GT9C337&location=584))
- Harassing behavior, on the other hand, can be sorted in two ways, by investment and by impact. ([Location 593](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GT9C337&location=593))
- When sorted by investment, harassing behavior is defined according to the investment that the harasser makes in their efforts. ... Sustained Hounding. This is, more or less, stalking—a person acting solo who doggedly goes after one or more individuals, ... Sustained Orchestration. Orchestration is crowdsourced abuse—the recruitment of others into harassing someone in a sustained campaign. ... Low-Level Mobbing. This is the behavior of those who are recruited into a sustained campaign, but never themselves become orchestrators of the campaign. ... Drive-By Harassment. Just some random person being terrible as a one-off. ... Emotional Harm. Emotional harm can run the gamut from being mildly put off, to being driven to serious distress and even depression. ... Economic Harm. Economic harm can be done by going after a target’s job, ... Personal Harm. This includes assault, assault by proxy (SWATting), and compromising the target’s privacy through, for example, doxing or hacking ([Location 594](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GT9C337&location=594))
    - Tags: [[definition]] 
- When classified by impact, harassing behavior is defined by the long-term effect on the target. ([Location 606](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GT9C337&location=606))
- Legal systems should address the most extreme kinds of harassment: the overtly threatening harassing content, the personal harm, some types of economic harm, and perhaps even some forms of sustained orchestration. ([Location 616](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GT9C337&location=616))
- The technical architecture of online platforms, on the other hand, should be designed to dampen harassing behavior, while shielding targets from harassing content. ([Location 618](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GT9C337&location=618))
- Code is never neutral, and interfaces can signal all kinds of things to users. ([Location 623](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GT9C337&location=623))
#### On Modern-Day Social Media Content Moderation
- Bright-line rules should be crafted to best address the behavior, even if the rule itself applies to content. ([Location 642](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GT9C337&location=642))
##### Beyond Deletion
- An accountability process pulls a user aside, not only to put a check on their behavior, but also to rehabilitate them. ([Location 683](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GT9C337&location=683))
#### What Happens Before: Setting Norms
- Creating user investment in their community, ... is a matter of both moderation and architecture. It’s not just a touchy-feely thing—it’s also a technical problem, ([Location 725](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GT9C337&location=725))
- It’s cyclical: when people are invested in the community, the community will police and enforce norms, but when unrepentant bad actors are never banished or are able to reproduce their presence at an alarming rate (sockpuppeting), community trust and investment will evaporate. ([Location 728](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GT9C337&location=728))
### Chapter Three: Lessons from Copyright Law ... The Intersection of Copyright and Harassment
#### How the DMCA Taught Us All the Wrong Lessons
- When you assume that your only recourse for safety is deletion, you don’t have very many options. ([Location 802](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GT9C337&location=802))
- It’s often very difficult to target the poster directly. ... So usually, when seeking to delete something off the web, wronged individuals go after the platform that hosts the content. The problem is that those platforms are mostly immunized through Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act ([Location 803](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GT9C337&location=803))
##### The Digital Millennium Copyright Act
##### The Communications Decency Act, Section 230
- There are very few exceptions to CDA 230. One notable exception is federal law banning child pornography. But the big one is copyrighted material. Copyright infringement is not shielded by CDA 230—instead, any violations are regulated by the provisions of the DMCA instead. ([Location 824](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GT9C337&location=824))
- Strangely, the Stratton Oakmont decision discouraged moderation and encouraged services to leave their boards open as a free-for-all. Legislators sought to reverse Stratton Oakmont by creating CDA 230. ([Location 832](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GT9C337&location=832))
##### Changing CDA 230?
- CDA 230 was a shield intended to encourage site moderation and voluntary processes for removal of offensive material. Ironically, it is presently also the greatest stumbling block for many of the anti-harassment proposals floating around today. ([Location 836](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GT9C337&location=836))
- Any legislation laying out a new exception, no matter how carefully crafted from the start, will likely suffer from mission creep, making the exception bigger and bigger. ([Location 845](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GT9C337&location=845))
- It is rhetorically difficult to oppose those who claim to represent exploited women and children, so various interest groups will tack on their agendas in hopes of flying under the cover of a good cause. ([Location 847](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GT9C337&location=847))
#### Turning Hate Crimes into Copyright Crimes
- What’s striking about the September 2014 incident is that in removing the offending subreddit, Reddit did not appeal to morals, the invasion of privacy, Reddit’s pre-existing rule against doxing (the nonconsensual publication of personal information), or the likely crime that had occurred in acquiring the photos in the first place. Instead, Reddit cited DMCA notices, effectively placing copyright as a priority over any of those other rationales. ([Location 886](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GT9C337&location=886))
- Regardless of their motivations, both Reddit and Cindy Lee Garcia fell into the same trap: They turned a hate crime into a copyright crime. ([Location 890](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GT9C337&location=890))
- The censorship of the early internet has revolved around copyright enforcement, rather than the safety of vulnerable internet users. ([Location 899](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GT9C337&location=899))
- Yet an anti-harassment strategy that models itself after internet copyright enforcement is bound to fail. ([Location 902](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GT9C337&location=902))
- Content removal is a game of whack-a-mole, ([Location 905](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GT9C337&location=905))
##### The Illusive Goal of Total Control
- Any anti-harassment strategy that focuses on deletion and removal is doomed to spin in circles, damned to the Sisyphean task of stamping out infinitely replicable information. ([Location 927](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GT9C337&location=927))
- And that’s a matter of architectural reconfiguration, filtering, community management, norm-enforcement, and yes, some deletion. But deletion should be thought of one tool in the toolbox, not the end goal. Because deletion isn’t victory, liberation or freedom from fear. It’s just deletion. ([Location 931](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GT9C337&location=931))
### Chapter Four: A Different Kind of Free Speech
#### Stuck on Free Speech
- The First Amendment does not apply to online platforms. ... The First Amendment only applies to government action. ([Location 949](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GT9C337&location=949))
- A “true threat” doesn’t mean that the threatener actually intends to carry out the threat. ... A true threat doesn’t have to be factual in order to be true; it’s true because it makes the recipient fear serious violence and is intended to make them afraid. ([Location 956](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GT9C337&location=956))
- Hate speech is protected under the First Amendment. Of course, not all hate speech. Hate speech that runs afoul of the Brandenburg Test, or turns into a true threat, is not protected. ([Location 968](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GT9C337&location=968))
#### The Marketplace of Ideas
#### Social Media is a Monopoly
- Social media has an enormous distorting effect on what we perceive as civic participants. ([Location 1046](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GT9C337&location=1046))
- The internet is presently siloed off into several major private platforms. Each silo is maintained by, in the words of the ACLU, “a near-absolute ruler that can set any rule, squelch any speech, expel any ‘citizen’ for any reason, with only the due process protections it sees fit to spend money on.” ([Location 1056](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GT9C337&location=1056))
#### Agoras and Responsibilities
- Reddit’s supposed commitment to free speech is actually a punting of responsibility. It is expensive for Reddit to make and maintain the rules that would keep subreddits orderly, on-topic, and not full of garbage (or at least, not hopelessly full of garbage). Only by giving their moderators near absolute power (under the guise of “free speech”) can Reddit exist in the first place. ([Location 1081](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GT9C337&location=1081))
##### The New Agoras
- Effective anti-harassment can make a freer marketplace of ideas, rather than inhibiting it. ([Location 1099](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GT9C337&location=1099))
- When we seek to build truly equal platforms and marketplaces of ideas fit for the 21st century, we are trying to create things that have never existed and cannot be constructed by mindlessly applying principles of the past. ([Location 1119](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GT9C337&location=1119))
- Unbeknownst to most users of the internet, we constantly live on the brink of being swallowed up by garbage content. ([Location 1124](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GT9C337&location=1124))
### Chapter Five: Spam: The Mother of All Garbage
#### What Is Spam?
- Spam is the internet’s ever-present sickness, permanently occupying the attention of a vast and hyper-intelligent immune system. ([Location 1138](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GT9C337&location=1138))
- “American firms and consumers experience costs of almost $20 billion annually due to spam.” (The worst part is that they also estimated that spammers worldwide only gross about $200 million annually.) ([Location 1144](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GT9C337&location=1144))
- But today, as we face a very similar debate with harassment, comparisons to spam are rarely made, even though it’s almost nearly the same problem—that is, the problem of garbage removal. ([Location 1153](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GT9C337&location=1153))
##### The Anti-Spam War Machine
#### Spam and Free Speech
- The very first “spam” message, according to Finn Brunton, was in fact political speech: an unsolicited mass mailing sent out on the Compatible Time-Sharing System (CTSS) network that had been developed at MIT, a network similar to but different from the internet’s direct predecessor, ARPANET. The message was a long, impassioned antiwar speech, beginning with: “THERE IS NO WAY TO PEACE. PEACE IS THE WAY.” The “spammer” was Peter Bos, a sysadmin who had used his special privileges on CTSS to mass-message everyone. When his superior told him it was “inappropriate and possibly unwelcome,” he replied that it was important. Sending the message out through CTSS meant it would reach an audience of scientists and engineers likely to be working on defense-related projects—for Bos, his unwanted mass mailing was a matter of conscience. ([Location 1197](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GT9C337&location=1197))
- What client-side spam filtering does is—depending on your point of view—either give freedom to the user to decide or punt responsibility for garbage disposal to the user. Being responsible for defining spam on your own or opting in to certain blacklists is simultaneously better and worse for you. It is both freeing and burdensome. In contrast, server-side filtering has enormous benefits in terms of efficiency and network effects, even if it takes agency away from the end-user. ([Location 1224](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GT9C337&location=1224))
#### Harassment as Spam
- For large-scale sustained campaigns and short-term pile-ons, harassment is harmful not just because of threats or the general emotional impact; it is also harmful because it makes the internet completely useless. ([Location 1235](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GT9C337&location=1235))
- Patterning harassment directly after anti-spam is not the answer, but there are obvious parallels. The real question to ask here is, Why haven’t these parallels been explored yet? ... A snide response might be that if harassment disproportionately impacts women, then spam disproportionately impacts men... ([Location 1254](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GT9C337&location=1254))
#### Architectural Solutions to Harassment
- Nonetheless, anti-spam is an important lesson. Garbage can be mitigated by and disposed of through architectural solutions—in other words, by code. Manual deletion, manual banning and legal action are not the only tools in the toolkit. ([Location 1282](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GT9C337&location=1282))
- Dealing with garbage is time-consuming and emotionally taxing. That’s why social media companies pay people to do it full time, and why those employees often feel the need to stop after a few years. ([Location 1301](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GT9C337&location=1301))
- Meanwhile, in more technical circles, the bemused question was raised—why hadn’t Gawker Media just disabled gif embedding on anonymous burner accounts? This is one example where architecture can operate in tandem with moderation. ([Location 1321](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GT9C337&location=1321))
- Technical and manual garbage-removal are two sides of the same coin, and must work together if garbage is to be taken (out) seriously. ([Location 1326](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GT9C337&location=1326))
#### On the Size of the Internet
- Harassment doesn’t happen because the internet is “too big”—it happens because it’s too small. Part of this has to do with thoughtless user interface design. When it comes to Twitter, an @-reply feels offensive because it “invades” your online space; it’s a message delivered straight to your face because the Twitter user interface is designed to make @-replies visible. ([Location 1352](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GT9C337&location=1352))
- examination of sustained harassment campaigns shows that they are often coordinated out of another online space. ([Location 1355](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GT9C337&location=1355))
- Anti-harassment is about giving the harassed space on the internet, and keeping the electronic frontier open for them. ([Location 1368](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GT9C337&location=1368))
#### Conclusion: The Two Futures of Anti-Harassment
- Even a low-level explosion of sub-threatening harassment should be of concern to tech companies, especially social platforms that rely on user-generated content, because these services have three dictates: Attracting users Building architecture to attract content from those users Removing or hiding the inevitable accumulation of garbage content. Online harassment as content simply falls into the larger, broader, pre-existing category of garbage. ([Location 1383](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GT9C337&location=1383))
- Throughout the history of the internet, communities, open-source projects, and standards groups have grappled with the problem of garbage. Now corporations grapple with it as well, and have unfortunately defaulted to the worst stratagems of capitalism—first, by punting responsibility to consumers, and second, by outsourcing to underpaid contractors or, worse, to overseas sweatshops. ([Location 1388](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GT9C337&location=1388))
- Rather than understanding it as non-technical support tacked onto a technical product, platform cultivation should be understood as a multidisciplinary effort that is integral to the product itself. The basic code of a product can encourage, discourage, or even prevent the proliferation of garbage. An engineer’s work can exacerbate harassment, or it can aid a community moderator. ([Location 1396](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GT9C337&location=1396))
- What led the reforms that Riot Games instituted was a “player behavior team” of people with “PhDs in psychology, cognitive science, and neuroscience to study the issue of harassment by building and analyzing behavioral profiles for tens of millions of users.” Riot Games assembled a panel of experts to design bespoke solutions for their product; their experts delivered. ([Location 1414](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GT9C337&location=1414))
- Placing user safety in the hands of low-paid contractors under a great deal of pressure to perform as quickly as possible is not an ethical outcome for either the user or the contractor. ([Location 1423](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GT9C337&location=1423))
- People will never stop being horrible on the internet. There will never not be garbage. But in a functioning society, someone comes to collect the trash every week. If private platforms are to become communities, collectives, agoras, tiny new societies, they have to make a real effort to collect the garbage. ([Location 1433](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GT9C337&location=1433))
