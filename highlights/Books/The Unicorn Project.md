## Highlights
### PROLOGUE • Tuesday, September 2
### CHAPTER 1 • Wednesday, September 3
- Maxine thinks, I expect leaders to buffer their people from all the political and bureaucratic insanity, not throw them into it. ([Location 201](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QT9QR41&location=201))
- Although long hours are sometimes glorified in popular culture, Maxine views them as a symptom of something going very wrong. ([Location 282](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QT9QR41&location=282))
- She wonders what is happening: Too many promises to the market? Bad engineering leadership? Bad product leadership? Too much technical debt? Not enough focus on architectures and platforms that enable developers to be productive? ([Location 283](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QT9QR41&location=283))
- Without constant feedback from a centralized build, integration, and test system, they really have no idea what will happen when all their work is merged with everyone else’s. ([Location 332](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QT9QR41&location=332))
- When you hire a plumber or a carpenter, you expect them to bring their own tools. But in a software organization with more than one developer, the entire team uses common tools to be productive. ([Location 344](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QT9QR41&location=344))
- If the Phoenix development setup were a product, it would be the worst product ever. ([Location 370](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QT9QR41&location=370))
    - Note: Point: think of things other than the end-user product as products, as an evaluative lens.
### CHAPTER 2 • Friday, September 5th
- there’s something even more important than code: the systems that enable developers to be productive, so that they can write high-quality code quickly and safely, freeing themselves from all the things that prevent them from solving important business problems. ([Location 410](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QT9QR41&location=410))
- Papers We Love ([Location 428](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QT9QR41&location=428))
    - Tags: [[inbox]] 
- applying the strangler pattern to dismantle decades-old code monoliths and replacing them safely, confidently, and brilliantly. ([Location 441](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QT9QR41&location=441))
    - Tags: [[inbox]] 
- She’s baffled that no one knows of an actual person who uses Phoenix. Just who are they building all this code for? ([Location 481](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QT9QR41&location=481))
- when engineers think of “the customer” in the abstract instead of as a real person, you rarely get the right outcomes. ([Location 575](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QT9QR41&location=575))
- “Remember, safety is a precondition of work.” ([Location 649](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QT9QR41&location=649))
### CHAPTER 3 • Monday, September 8
- Everyone around here thinks features are important, because they can see them in their app, on the web page, or in the API. But no one seems to realize how important the build process is. ([Location 666](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QT9QR41&location=666))
- they should be writing code in a production-like environment so they can get fast feedback on whether the code they write works with the system as a whole. ([Location 709](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QT9QR41&location=709))
- developers need a system where they can get fast and continual feedback on the quality of their work. If you don’t find problems quickly, you end up finding them months later. By then, the problem is lost in all the other changes that every other developer made, so the link between cause and effect disappears without a trace. That’s no way to run any project.” ([Location 771](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QT9QR41&location=771))
- As she falls asleep, she tries not to think about how much of her life is spent searching the internet for how to make error messages go away. ([Location 810](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QT9QR41&location=810))
- Just because she felt busy doesn’t mean that she actually did anything meaningful. ([Location 812](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QT9QR41&location=812))
- Maxine refuses to lose her cool. These people are trying to help her. ([Location 900](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QT9QR41&location=900))
- Maxine suddenly becomes alarmed at just how many people are required to create one environment. ([Location 938](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QT9QR41&location=938))
- I run my program every time I change anything, just to make sure it still compiles and runs. That way, I don’t make the same mistake for hours without knowing. Better to catch the mistake the first time you make it, right?” ([Location 973](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QT9QR41&location=973))
- Maxine is pleased, because even this small exercise has banished some unnecessary complexity from the world. It might save the girls from decades of frustration and make the world a safer place. ([Location 1000](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QT9QR41&location=1000))
- The joy of teaching people something that they want to learn is awesome. ([Location 1004](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QT9QR41&location=1004))
- As the project owner, she sees it as her primary responsibility to ensure that any contributor can be productive. ([Location 1025](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QT9QR41&location=1025))
- it’s dispiriting when you submit a change to someone’s project, but no one ever looks at it or they tell you that it can’t be integrated. If that happens enough, people eventually give up or fork your project and splinter the community. ([Location 1028](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QT9QR41&location=1028))
- agility is never free. Over time, without this type of investment, software often becomes more and more difficult to change. ([Location 1033](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QT9QR41&location=1033))
- healthy software system is one that you can change at the speed you need, where people can contribute easily, without jumping through hoops. ([Location 1036](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QT9QR41&location=1036))
- She is able to build things with focus, flow, and joy. She had fast feedback in her work. People were able to do what they wanted without being dependent on scores of other people. This is what great architecture enables. ([Location 1052](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QT9QR41&location=1052))
### CHAPTER 4 • Thursday, September 11
- “You think our change management process can be slow? We’re speed demons compared to Information Security.” ([Location 1185](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QT9QR41&location=1185))
- The job of the bridge crew is to ensure the company strategy is viable, not to remind them of the strategy or to micromanage everyone to death. Their job should be to ensure everyone can get their work done. ([Location 1227](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QT9QR41&location=1227))
- There is nothing so rewarding as providing something to someone who really needs your help. ([Location 1247](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QT9QR41&location=1247))
- having a great build process is key to having a good code deployment and release process. ([Location 1275](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QT9QR41&location=1275))
- Each decision is a commitment to support it for years or even decades—these are decisions that go far beyond just one team. ([Location 1287](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QT9QR41&location=1287))
### CHAPTER 5 • Thursday, September 11
- ‘Without automated testing, the more code we write, the more money it takes for us to test.’ ([Location 1449](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QT9QR41&location=1449))
- It’s like in that movie Brazil, where the number-one fugitive is the rogue air conditioner repairman who fixes people’s air conditioners because Central Services never gets around to it. That’s us. We’re always on the lookout for places we can help. It’s a great way to make friends and find potential new recruits for the Rebellion.” ([Location 1471](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QT9QR41&location=1471))
- this is what an effective network is all about—when you can assemble a group of motivated people to solve a big problem, even though the team looks nothing like the official org chart. ([Location 1520](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QT9QR41&location=1520))
- There’s a new, maybe even sinister, dynamic creeping into the Phoenix Project. In each of the outage calls and crisis management meetings, senior leaders seem to be going out of their way to posture about how they did their job but other people didn’t do their jobs, ([Location 1678](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QT9QR41&location=1678))
- While the redshirts battle to contain the raging engine fire that is threatening the entire ship, the bridge officers continue to cover their asses, ([Location 1680](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QT9QR41&location=1680))
- Project Management has turned into an army of paper pushers, being dragged into every single task because of all the dependencies. ([Location 1810](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QT9QR41&location=1810))
### CHAPTER 7 • Thursday, September 18
- You’re not only magnificently meeting the business objectives, you’ve also created a system where small teams of engineers are able to work productively and independently of each other, with components painstakingly and splendidly isolated from each other, instead of being complected into a giant, ugly, knotty mess. ([Location 1882](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QT9QR41&location=1882))
- And even more impressive is your ruthless eradication of technical debt as a part of your daily work. ([Location 1886](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QT9QR41&location=1886))
- tightly coupled and complected systems, it’s nearly impossible to change anything, because you can’t just change one area of the code, you must change one hundred, or even a thousand, areas of the code. And even the smallest changes can cause wildly unpredictable effects in distant parts of the system, maybe in something you’ve never even heard of. ([Location 1892](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QT9QR41&location=1892))
- “Code deployment lead time, code deployment frequency, and time to resolve problems are predictive of software delivery, operational performance, and organizational performance, and they correlate with burnout, employee engagement, and so much more. ([Location 1912](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QT9QR41&location=1912))
- “You should be able to create value by changing one file, one module, one service, one component, one API call, one container, one app, or whatever! Which is why putting cross-cutting concerns in one place is so great, like logging, security, or retry policies. You change it there, and you’ve changed it everywhere,” ([Location 1918](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QT9QR41&location=1918))
- There are many things that people call technical debt, but it usually refers to things we need to clean up, or where we need to create or restore simplicity, so that that we can quickly, confidently, and safely make changes to the system. ([Location 1934](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QT9QR41&location=1934))
    - Tags: [[definition]] 
- “There are Five Ideals,” Erik begins. The whole table turns their attention to him. “I’ve already told you about the First Ideal of Locality and Simplicity. We need to design things so that we have locality in our systems and the organizations that build them. And we need simplicity in everything we do. The last place we want complexity is internally, whether it’s in our code, in our organization, or in our processes. The external world is complex enough, so it would be intolerable if we allow it in things we can actually control! We must make it easy to do our work.” ([Location 1972](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QT9QR41&location=1972))
- “The Second Ideal is Focus, Flow, and Joy. It’s all about how our daily work feels. Is our work marked by boredom and waiting for other people to get things done on our behalf? Do we blindly work on small pieces of the whole, only seeing the outcomes of our work during a deployment when everything blows up, leading to firefighting, punishment, and burnout? Or do we work in small batches, ideally single-piece flow, getting fast and continual feedback on our work? These are the conditions that allow for focus and flow, challenge, learning, discovery, mastering our domain, and even joy.” ([Location 1977](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QT9QR41&location=1977))
- The Third Ideal is Improvement of Daily Work. Reflect upon what the Toyota Andon cord teaches us about how we must elevate improvement of daily work over daily work itself. ([Location 1986](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QT9QR41&location=1986))
- The Fourth Ideal is Psychological Safety, where we make it safe to talk about problems, because solving problems requires prevention, which requires honesty, and honesty requires the absence of fear. ([Location 1987](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QT9QR41&location=1987))
- Fifth Ideal is Customer Focus, where we ruthlessly question whether something actually matters to our customers, as in, are they willing to pay us for it or is it only of value to our functional silo?” ([Location 1989](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QT9QR41&location=1989))
- The First Ideal—Locality and Simplicity
  The Second Ideal—Focus, Flow, and Joy
  The Third Ideal—Improvement of Daily Work
  The Fourth Ideal—Psychological Safety
  The Fifth Ideal—Customer Focus ([Location 1992](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QT9QR41&location=1992))

- Technology is still too often a caste system. ([Location 2014](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QT9QR41&location=2014))
- I believe my job my job is very simple: listen, do whatever you need me to do to help make you successful, and remove any obstacles in your way.” ([Location 2087](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QT9QR41&location=2087))
- Software is like a city, constantly undergoing change, needing renovations and repair. ([Location 2114](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QT9QR41&location=2114))
- It is almost impossible to predict how a program will behave if any other part of the program can change data that you’re depending on at any time, ([Location 2139](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QT9QR41&location=2139))
- She likes finishing things, not just starting things. ([Location 2185](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QT9QR41&location=2185))

- “We need developers to be able to focus their best energies on building features, not trying to get builds to work. ([Location 2292](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QT9QR41&location=2292))
- She has seen how engineers can become the constraint many times in her career. It can be fun to be at the center of everything, but it’s certainly not sustainable. Down that road, only chronic wakeup calls, exhaustion, cynicism, and burnout await. ([Location 2312](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QT9QR41&location=2312))
- “Technical debt is a fact of life, like deadlines. Business people understand deadlines, but often are completely oblivious that technical debt even exists. Technical debt is inherently neither good nor bad—it happens because in our daily work, we are always making trade-off decisions,” he says. “To make the date, sometimes we take shortcuts, or skip writing our automated tests, or hard-code something for a very specific case, knowing that it won’t work in the long-term. Sometimes we tolerate daily workarounds, like manually creating an environment or manually performing a deployment. We make a grave mistake when we don’t realize how much this impacts our future productivity.” ([Location 2338](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QT9QR41&location=2338))
- “Business people can see features or apps, so getting funding for those is easy,” he continues. “But they don’t see the vast architectures underneath that support them, connecting systems, teams, and data to each other. And underneath that is something extraordinarily important: the systems that developers use in their daily work to be productive. “It’s funny: the tech giants assign their very best engineers to that bottom layer, so that every developer can benefit. But at Parts Unlimited, the very best engineers work on features at that top layer, with no one besides interns on the bottom working on Dev productivity. ([Location 2367](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QT9QR41&location=2367))
- Every developer uses a common build environment. Every developer is supported by a continuous build and integration system. Everyone can run their code in production-like environments. Automated test suites are built to replace manual testing, liberating QA people to do higher value work. Architecture is decoupled to liberate feature teams, so developers can deliver value independently. All the data that teams need is put in easily consumed APIs … ([Location 2389](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QT9QR41&location=2389))
- Problems must be solved on the front-lines, where daily work is performed by the world’s foremost experts who confront those problems most often. ([Location 2404](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QT9QR41&location=2404))
- “For the leader, it no longer means directing and controlling, but guiding, enabling, and removing obstacles. ([Location 2420](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QT9QR41&location=2420))
- transformational leadership,” ... “It requires understanding the vision of the organization, the intellectual stimulation to question the basic assumptions of how work is performed, inspirational communication, personal recognition, and supportive leadership. ([Location 2424](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QT9QR41&location=2424))
- “When something goes wrong, we ask ‘what caused the problem,’ not ‘who.’ We commit to doing what it takes to make tomorrow better than today. ([Location 2435](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QT9QR41&location=2435))
    - Tags: [[favorite]] 
- Psychological safety slips away so easily, like when the leader micromanages, can’t say ‘I don’t know,’ or acts like a know-it-all, pompous jackass. And it’s not just leaders, it’s also how one’s peers behave.” ([Location 2442](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QT9QR41&location=2442))
- Safety is a precondition of work.’” ([Location 2482](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QT9QR41&location=2482))
- fixing safety issues should never be budgeted—just fix it, and they’d figure out how to pay for it later,” ([Location 2493](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QT9QR41&location=2493))

### CHAPTER 9 • Monday, September 29
- Great QA people are notoriously good at breaking other people’s code. ([Location 2676](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QT9QR41&location=2676))
- Moreover, these automated tests would be run every time a developer checks in code, giving fast and immediate feedback ([Location 2686](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QT9QR41&location=2686))
- not just to do the right things, but to do the right things right. ([Location 2754](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QT9QR41&location=2754))
### CHAPTER 10 • Monday, September 29
### CHAPTER 11 • Wednesday, October 1
- “And Shannon is paving the road for Security,” Kurt says. “Environment images will be automatically patched daily, and maybe soon, application dependencies too!” ([Location 3055](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QT9QR41&location=3055))
- Immutability is another concept from functional programming that is making the world a more predictable and safer place, ([Location 3202](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QT9QR41&location=3202))
- “Every developer knows that in the next interval, they need to write automated tests as they write the feature, not afterward. ([Location 3207](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QT9QR41&location=3207))
- fast and frequent feedback is such a big part of achieving the Second Ideal of Focus, Flow, and Joy. ([Location 3227](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QT9QR41&location=3227))
### CHAPTER 12 • Monday, October 13
- “Hey, could you at least give us all of the testing procedures that you’ll use to certify Data Hub, along with a list of tools you use to scan it? We’ll do our best to replicate it in our automated test suite. Maybe we can generate security audit reports for you on-demand.” ([Location 3358](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QT9QR41&location=3358))
- The goal is clear: enable fast and safe deployments into production, and for the first time in years, do it using the same environments across Dev, Test, and Production. ([Location 3491](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QT9QR41&location=3491))
- Data Hub had become this fragile and irreproducible artifact. That’s great if you’re an art collector, Maxine thinks, but utterly unacceptable when you’re running a mission-critical service. ([Location 3497](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QT9QR41&location=3497))
- Early in her career, the ratio of UX and designers to developers was 1:70. These days, great teams doing consumer-oriented products have ratios of 1:6 because it’s that important to create products that people love. ([Location 3534](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QT9QR41&location=3534))
### CHAPTER 13 • Thursday, November 6th
- “Good hypothesis, Brent. What are you thinking? How can we test your idea?” ([Location 3628](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QT9QR41&location=3628))
- “Every time we have an outage, we’ll be conducting a blameless post-mortem like this one. The spirit and intent of these sessions are to learn from them, chronicling what happened before memories fade. Prevention requires honesty, and honesty requires the absence of fear. Just like Norm Kerth says in the Agile Prime Directive, ‘Regardless of what we discover, we understand and truly believe that everyone did the best job they could, given what they knew at the time, their skills and abilities, the resources available, and the situation at hand.’ ([Location 3714](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QT9QR41&location=3714))
    - Tags: [[favorite]] 
- The goal is to enable the people closest to the problem to share what they saw, so we can make our systems safer. ([Location 3720](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QT9QR41&location=3720))
- Maxine is certain that everyone has learned something about how Data Hub actually works, in stark contrast with their mental models of how they thought it works. She records a list of five things people will change right away that will likely prevent future outages and will certainly make fixing certain problems faster in the future. ([Location 3750](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QT9QR41&location=3750))
- “In order to speak clearly, you need to be able to think clearly. And to think clearly, you usually need to be able to write it clearly.” ([Location 3941](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QT9QR41&location=3941))
    - Tags: [[favorite]] 
- He said he thought it was important to think through problems clearly, and for him, writing things down enforced a logical rigor that he thought was very important for leaders to have. “How can you send a company down a strategic path when you haven’t thought through what all the implications are?” ([Location 3946](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QT9QR41&location=3946))
- She knows some things that she observed yesterday don’t belong in her head. They need to be in front of the people whose daily work it is to write and maintain the applications that the in-store employees rely on. ([Location 3950](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QT9QR41&location=3950))
### CHAPTER 14 • Monday, November 10
- This is not a story about small beating large; it’s fast beats slow. What the past couple of months have decisively proven to her is that greatness can be stifled, but it can also be restored. ([Location 4036](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QT9QR41&location=4036))
- “For those of you not in technology, ‘technical debt’ is what creates hardship, toil, and reduces the agility of our software engineers,” ([Location 4073](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QT9QR41&location=4073))
- “Just like in manufacturing, where I come from, it’s important to have a sustainable work pace and to limit our work in process to make sure that work keeps moving through the plant. And that’s what we’re doing here. ([Location 4077](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QT9QR41&location=4077))
- And unlike the centralized Data Warehouse, the responsibility for cleaning, ingesting, analyzing, and publishing accurate data to the rest of the organization would be pushed into each business and application team, where they have the most knowledge of what the data actually means.” ([Location 4202](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QT9QR41&location=4202))
- Shannon is passionate about how this platform must ensure the security of all this data, not leaving it to each individual team. ([Location 4206](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QT9QR41&location=4206))
- They defer the event streaming platform, but Maxine and Shannon will lead the creation of something that can provide more bulletproof data transformations, get things under version control, build automated testing to confirm the correct shape and size of data before it’s ingested, and so many other things to prevent all these data accidents she’s seen and heard about. ([Location 4237](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QT9QR41&location=4237))
### CHAPTER 15 • Tuesday, November 25
- As Maggie said, the plan is to do a trial run against a small subset of customers to test their readiness for the full-scale campaign on Friday—so at eleven a.m. they will conduct a campaign to just one percent of their customers. They’re doing this in the middle of the day, when everyone will already be in the office and able to quickly respond to emergencies. This will help them find vulnerabilities and weaknesses in the process so they can fix them before Friday. ([Location 4348](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QT9QR41&location=4348))
- Over the last week, Brent and his team have been stress-testing the entire system, routinely causing parts of the technology landscape to blow up. And then in a blameless post-mortem, they’d all work together to figure out how to fix things so that they’ll survive the actual launch. The results of these “Chaos Engineering” exercises resulted in some surprising things breaking. But everyone has been working diligently, trying to ensure that they are as prepared as they can be for the big launch event.

- When everyone knows what the goals are, as Erik predicted, teams will self-organize to best achieve those goals. ([Location 4385](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QT9QR41&location=4385))
    - Note: question then is: how do they organize well, and are they getting training to be good at that on top of their other duties? Do they have learning bandwidth to learn that skill, too?
- They realize that they are on a journey of learning and exploration, and that making mistakes is inevitable. Creating ever-safer systems and continual improvement is now viewed as part of daily work. ([Location 4389](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QT9QR41&location=4389))

- he was very proud that hundreds of plant worker suggestions were put into production to improve safety, to reduce toil, to increase quality, and to increase flow. That too is also a form of continual experimentation. You now need it at a much larger level, liberated from the tyranny of project management and functional silos. ([Location 4685](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QT9QR41&location=4685))
- “The Fifth Ideal is about a ruthless Customer Focus, where you are truly striving for what is best for them, instead of the more parochial goals that they don’t care about, whether it’s your internal plans of record or how your functional silos are measured,” he says. “Instead we ask whether our daily actions truly improve the lives of our customer, create value for them, and whether they’d pay for it. And if they don’t, maybe we shouldn’t be doing it at all.” ([Location 4688](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QT9QR41&location=4688))
### CHAPTER 16 • Friday, December 5
- employee engagement and customer satisfaction are the only things that matter. If we do that right, and manage cash effectively, every other financial target will take care of itself.” ([Location 4759](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QT9QR41&location=4759))
- “What I’ve learned in Promotions is that it’s an extremely experimental process, an exercise of exploration and learning. Not every idea is a winner,” she says. “For every winning idea, there are many losing ideas. And some of the winners seemed outright crazy and never would have been approved by the typical middle-manager or committee. The literature suggests that in general, only one out of every three strategic ideas has a positive result, and only a third actually move the needle in a material way. ([Location 4796](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QT9QR41&location=4796))
- “We need to have some way to quickly shut down bets that don’t pan out and to double-down on the winners. ([Location 4803](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QT9QR41&location=4803))
- “Horizon 1 is your successful, cash-cow businesses, where the customer, business, and operational models are well-known and predictable. ([Location 4816](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QT9QR41&location=4816))

#### “Which is why Horizon 2 lines of business are so important, because they represent the future of the company. They may introduce the company’s capabilities to new customers, adjacent markets, or with different business models. These endeavors may not be profitable, but this is where we find higher-growth areas. It is from here that enterprising leaders create the next generation of Horizon 1 businesses.
- “You may have guessed that Horizon 2 efforts come from Horizon 3, where the focus is on velocity of learning and having a broad pool of ideas to explore,” he says. “Here, the name of the game is to prototype ideas and to answer as quickly as possible the three questions of market risk, technical risk, and business model risk: Does the idea solve a real customer need? Is it technically feasible? And is there a financially feasible engine of growth? If the answer is no to any of them, it’s time to pivot or kill the idea. “If the answer is yes, then the idea is continually developed until it earns the right to graduate to Horizon 2, where the business builders take over,” ([Location 4824](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QT9QR41&location=4824))

- “Horizon 1 thrives on process and consistency, on rules and compliance, and on bureaucracies, which create extraordinary resilience. These are the mechanisms that allow greatness to be consistently delivered over decades. ([Location 4832](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QT9QR41&location=4832))
- “In contrast, in Horizon 3, you must go fast, you must be constantly experimenting, and you must be allowed to break all the rules and processes governing Horizon 1,” ([Location 4833](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QT9QR41&location=4833))
- “Speed matters. Or more precisely, lead time from idea to market offering matters,” ([Location 4843](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QT9QR41&location=4843))
- Horizon 1 and Horizon 3 are often in conflict with each other.” He gestures at Sarah meaningfully. “Left unchecked, Horizon 1 leaders will consume all the resources of the company. They will note correctly that they are the lifeblood of the company, but that’s only true in the short term. There is an instinct to maximize profitability and take cash out of the business instead of reinvesting it. This is the ‘manage to value’ thesis and is the opposite of ‘manage to growth.’ If you want growth, Steve, you must protect Horizons 2 and 3, and any learnings generated there must be spread throughout the company.” ([Location 4847](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QT9QR41&location=4847))
- “What if psychological safety is as much of a precondition to dynamic, learning organizations as physical safety?” ([Location 4855](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QT9QR41&location=4855))
- “two in a box,” occupying the same position in the org chart, sharing responsibility for the business and technical outcomes. ([Location 4887](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QT9QR41&location=4887))

- “You will be responsible for nurturing new, promising ideas and exploring market risk, technical risk, and business model risk,” Steve continues to summarize. “Each initiative will have clearly defined business outcome measures, such as customer acquisition, repeat customer usage, or customer satisfaction. At the end of each quarter, we’ll review progress on each initiative, and we’ll make a decision: continue funding the project; kill it, reassigning the team to the next best idea; double-down on the project; or graduate it to Horizon 2. We’ll also decide whether the entire program needs to be grown or shrunk. ([Location 4888](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QT9QR41&location=4888))

- Hoare principle: “There are two ways to write code: write code so simple there are obviously no bugs in it, or write code so complex that there are no obvious bugs in it.” ([Location 4953](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QT9QR41&location=4953))
- Whenever Unikitty goes down, they have a bunch of angry customers: their fellow developers. What better proof that Unikitty is an internal platform that they must manage like a product, not just as a project. It’s never done, if they want to keep their customers happy.

- On one extreme, you have Alan and Sarah’s way of creating value, which is just by cutting costs. You squeeze every bit of margin you can out of the operation. Some companies thrive at this, and some manage to malinger for decades, but most eventually fade and disappear,” ([Location 5085](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QT9QR41&location=5085))
- “On the other end of the spectrum, you can choose to build the company for growth. ([Location 5090](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QT9QR41&location=5090))
- “The easier thing to do is to just do what the board says. But the right thing to do is ensure that the Innovation program has its shot. It sucks, but as leaders there should be no doubt that cutting deeper is the right thing to do, because it creates a potential path to long-term growth.” ([Location 5100](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QT9QR41&location=5100))
- “Long term, we don’t want to manage our dependencies, we want to eliminate them,” ([Location 5109](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QT9QR41&location=5109))
- “Sensei Moore observed that many businesses understand the Three Horizons but are still unable to properly invest in the next generation of innovation. In other words, they underinvest in Core, because they are being controlled by Context. ([Location 5117](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QT9QR41&location=5117))
- “Cores are the central competencies of the organization. These are things that customers are willing to pay for and what investors reward,” ([Location 5119](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QT9QR41&location=5119))
- “Context is everything else. It’s the cafeterias, shuttles between buildings, and the thousands of things companies must do to operate. They’re often mission-critical, such as HR, payroll, and email. But our customers do not pay us for the great payroll services we provide to our employees. ([Location 5120](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QT9QR41&location=5120))
- “Not properly managing Context is what Sensei Moore called the killing ground of great companies. Companies who become too burdened by Context are unable to properly invest in Core. ([Location 5122](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QT9QR41&location=5122))
- how much of the $80 million of your technology spending is Core, actively building competitive advantage, and how much of it is Context, which is important and maybe even mission-critical, but still needs to be standardized, managed down, and maybe even outsourced entirely?” ([Location 5126](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QT9QR41&location=5126))
- of the applications and services that you manage, which of them are customers willing to pay you for? Which ones truly enhance competitive advantage? And which can you rely on vendors for? ([Location 5132](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QT9QR41&location=5132))

- “Those middle managers are your interface between strategy and execution,” he says. “They are your prioritizers and your traffic cops. We all have this ideal of small teams working independently, but who manages the teams of teams? It’s your middle managers. Some call them derisively the ‘frozen middle,’ but you’ll find that properly developing this layer of people is critical to execute strategy.

- Looking at the growing list of ignoble Context on the whiteboard, Maxine doesn’t feel dread. Instead, she feels inspired thinking about how jettisoning these things will liberate the company from things that slow it down and present the opportunity for engineers to work in areas of far higher value.

- People enthusiastically volunteered for engineering work that could make the system even safer. ([Location 5507](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QT9QR41&location=5507))
- People are always invited to join these blameless post-mortems, but she never expected so many engineers to show up. In fact, there wasn’t enough room for everyone, so many people joined online. These forums now had a reputation for being the fastest way to learn about the most innovative and exciting things in the company.
