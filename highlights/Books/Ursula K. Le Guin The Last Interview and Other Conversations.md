## Highlights
### The Gift of Place
- Le Guin:
  The thing about science fiction is, it isn't really about the future. It's about the present. (Page 3)
- Le Guin:
  We are learning to separate the stereotypes from the genuine archetype. (Page 8)

### Naming Magic
- Le Guin:
  "Yes for that book [The Left Hand of Darkness] I really had a notebook full of maps, and history, and all sorts of junk that didn't get into the book--or only got in because I *knew*--you know, you've got to *know*, whether it gets into the book or not, how long that last king reigned and stuff like that. (Page 39)
- Le Guin:
  They were not meant to go into the book, at first. I would hit snags with these people's psychology, as I was writing the book, and I would think, well, now, how would Therem [Estraven, the main character] really feel about this? And I would be snagged up. So, one of these myths would sort of pop out and write itself, and it would explain something to me, obviously working on a kind of unconscious level. Then I stuck most of them into the book; I finally decided that if they were a help to me they might help the reader, too. (Page 40)
- Le Guin:
  Yes. Yes. I cannot write to order. I cannot make a deal with a publisher until I can send him a completed manuscript. I can write essays and stuff to order; I learned how to write term papers in college. But writing fiction--I can't. I have to just wait and see what happens. (Page 44)
- Le Guin:
  Two people *can* do three fulltime jobs--teaching, writing and family. And when pressed I will admit that I think this sort of sharing arrangement is better, though much more tiring, than fifteen nursemaids, or than hiring help in any way. If I was "free," as so many male writers have been free, I would be impoverished. Why should all my time be my own, just because I write books? There are human responsibilities, and those include responsibilities to daily life, to common human work. I mean, cleaning up, cooking, all the work that must be done over and over all one's life, and also the school concert and the impossible geometry homework and so on. __Responsibility is privilege. If you delegate that work to others, you've copped out of the very source of your writing, which after all is life, isn't it, just living, people living and working and trying to get along.__ (Page 46)
### "There Is More Than One Way to See"
- Le Guin:
  ...you could very roughly say that the __English novelists of the nineteenth century and the Russian novelists of the twentieth century__ were very formative. That's where my love and admiration and emulation was when I started. But then I read all that other junk, too. (Page 56)
- Le Guin:
  ...I'm terrible at plotting, so all I do is sort of put people in motion and they go around in a circle and they generally end up about where they started out. That's a Le Guin plot. (Page 61)
- Le Guin:
  ...craftsmanship is just good technology (Page 63)
- Le Guin:
  This is going to look rather odd in print, but it really doesn't matter to me very much what sex people are, and this is my main problem as a feminist. __Every now and then I forget to be upset.__ (Page 70)
- Le Guin: 
  My conscience had to be raised a lot before I saw that. As of about the early seventies, it does matter. Now I can't do this innocently anymore, that innocence is gone. So now it matters a lot what one's protagonist is. I would defend my earlier books, because then it didn't matter. But now it does. (Page 72)
### In a World of Her Own
- Nora Gallagher:
  But what most American science fiction did before the late 1950s, when Le Guin's generation of science fiction writers began to publish, was to present the Other and then immediately defeat it: the aliens always got theirs in the end; the lean, square-jawed space captain shot his way through the swarm of bug-eyed monsters (with the dumb blonde clinging to his muscular arm); and the whole galaxy was made safe for free enterprise. __Probably more than any other writing, science fiction reflected the mood of America: if it's different, kill it.__ (Page 83)
- Nora Gallagher:
  She has described herself as "a __petty-bourgeois anarchist__," "an unconsistent Taoist and consistent unChristian." (Page 84)
    - Note: now I feel less ashamed and more honored to call myself a "bougie anarchist"
- Le Guin:
  ...I was not a theoretician, a political thinker or activist, or a sociologist. I was and am a fiction writer. __The way I did my thinking was to write a novel.__ That novel, *The Left Hand of Darkness*, is the record of my consciousness, the process of my thinking. (Page 85)
- Nora Gallagher:
  At the center of her thinking the question became: What would a planet be like if it didn't have any wars? (Page 85)
- Nora Gallagher:
  There have been violent anarchists, but __much of anarchy's bad name comes from successful propaganda against it__....To put it simply: anarchy is based on the realistic observation that people left to themselves, without the intervention of the state, tend to cooperate and work out their differences. This process may be awkward, inefficient and punctuated by fights, but its end result is usually more satisfying to everyone than when things are done by command. (Page 94)
- from *The Dispossessed*:
  "To make a thief, make an owner: to create crime, create laws" (Page 95)
- Nora Gallagher:
  Le Guin believes that Marxists and anarchists are their own best critics, "the only people that seem to speak to each other's main problems." (Page 98)
- Le Guin:
  ... it's so terribly low-grade, morally so cheap. *Star Wars* is really abominable: it's all violence, and there are only three women in the known universe....[these films] are not only non-intellectual, they are anti-intellectual and sort of deliberately stupid. But I would rather say that about *Star Wars*. I think Steven Spielberg, on the other hand, is playing a very tricky game. I think he knows. I think he deliberately exploits archetypal images in a way that I really dislike a lot. (Page 99)
    - Note: 1984, before much of the newer Star Wars
### Driven by a Different Chauffeur
- Nick Gevers:
  Le Guin is a subtly but firmly opinionated writer, and I posed her some deliberately provocative questions. She responded with a all the vigor I hoped for, pouncing on many of my stated assumptions with the kindly didacticism for which she is famed. So: if some of the questions below seem naïve or crass, please remember, reader, that they were sacrificial in nature... (Page 105)
- Le Guin:
  Apparently their logic is: if it isn't patriarchal, it has to be matriarchal. Hierarchism dies very hard, doesn't it? (Page 108)
- Le Guin:
  Observation, however, can be rewarding. As I never have been sure where my body leaves off and my mind begins or vice-versa, it seems unsurprising to me that the condition of one of them induces a similar condition in the other. (Page 109)
- Le Guin:
  The question of nostalgia deserves looking into. Much fantasy, and science fiction too, draws upon an apparently inalterable human longing for "the peaceable kingdom," the garden Voltaire suggested we cultivate. But terms must be used carefully and respectfully in such a discussion.
  Any refusal to accept the abuse of the world by ill-considered, misapplied technologies as desirable/inevitable can be labelled Luddite. All genuine alternatives to Industrial Capitalism can be, and are, dismissed as "nostalgia."
  __All ideals are positively dangerous__. All idealist are dangerous: Pol Pot, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Jefferson, Lenin, Osama Bin Laden, Francis of Assisi.
  __What is endangered__ and __how it is endangered__ may, however, vary.
  And there may be a difference--a subtle one, a crucial one--between __idealists__ and __ideologues__. (Page 110)
    - Note: compare this version of "peaceable kingdom" with the "beloved community" of MLKJ and the anabaptist conception of peaceable kingdom.
- Le Guin:
  ...throughout my whole adult life, I have watched us blighting our world irrevocably, irremediably, and mindlessly--ignoring every warning and neglecting every benevolent alternative in the pursuit of "growth" and immediate profit. It is quite hard to live in the United States in 2001 and feel any long term hopefulness about the unrelenting use of increasingly exploitative and destructive technologies: not so much weaponry, at this point, as technologies that could and should be useful and productive--fuel sources, agriculture, genetic engineering, even medicine. And, of course, we keep breeding. (Page 111)
- Le Guin:
  Believing that we have no future but that of high-tech development, urgent expansion, urbanization, and ruthless exploitation of natural and human resources--believing that we have to go on as we are going now--people tend to see that book [Always Coming Home] as backward-turning. It isn't. It looks at, but not back. It's a radical attempt to think outside current assumptions, a refusal of them. It's an attempt to portray a genuinely mature society. To imagine a "climax technology," the principle of which would not be enforced growth, but homeostasis. __To offer not a mechanical but organic model for culture__. (Page 112)
- Le Guin:
  The second [Earthsea] trilogy changes nothing in the first. It sees exactly the same world with different eyes. Almost, I would say, with two eyes, rather than one.
  __All the books are, in large part, fictional studies of power__. The first three see power mostly from the view of the powerful. The second three see power from the point of view of people who have none, or have lost it, or who can see their power as one of the illusions of mortality. (Page 114)
- Le Guin:
  ...I have finally come up with a name for books like *Four Ways* and *Searoad*--stories that are genuinely connected by place and/or theme and/or characters. Such a book is a __story suite__, on the analogy of Bach's cello suites. The story suite is a common enough form, particularly in science fiction, that I wish (dream on!) could be recognized as such--not labeled and dismissed as a collection, certainly not as a "fix-up," but seen as genuine fictional form in its own right, conceived as such not patched together, and with its own intriguing and complex aesthetic. (Page 115)

### Song of Herself
- Le Guin:
  They [her parents] were very loving and very patient, but they didn't hover. I wasn't very rebellious because there wasn't anything to rebel against. (Page 125)
- Le Guin:
  How do you know who you are if you're always with other people doing what they do? (Page 126)
- Le Guin:
  "Memoir? No. I'm like my father: I'm not interested in talking about who I was. I'm much more interested in finding out who I am. (Page 134)
### The Last Interview
- Le Guin chuckled frequently--the world amused her--but did not spare me when she felt I misunderstood something. (Page 138)
- In the evenings, she and Charles used these chairs to read to each other. Charles would read poetry first...and then Le Guin would do the prose....She would have a glass of mellow Speyside whisky. Charles, who hails from Georgia, would drink bourbon. (Page 138)
    - Note: precious!
      "armchairs, separated by the width of the fireplace"
- Le Guin:
  I have a website. I blog. I get email and send email. But I try and keep my distance. __The internet just invites crap from people__. (Page 142)
- Le Guin:
  I certainly didn't foresee Donald Trump. I was talking about longer-term hard times than that. For thirty years I've been saying, we are making the world uninhabitable, for God's sake. For forty years!
  That, as of old, was the writer's job, maybe his primary job. To show us the futures we didn't want, and the futures we could have if we wanted. The key line in the speech, for me, was the one about, "We live in capitalism, its power seems inescapable--but then, so did the divine right of kings." We can change our lives. (Page 146)
- Le Guin:
  But I like a well-made book, and the Library of America volumes are well made. And the editing seems to be done with great care, line editing like no one does anymore. (Page 148)
- Le Guin:
  I bullied them [Library of America] into doing Orsinia first. I didn't realize I was bullying them, but I was. They were very good-natured about it. They were going for the sci-fi, the science fiction, straight off and I kind of felt, okay, the Library of America is a literary series, and I've insisted for fifty years that __science fiction properly done is literature__. But it's not all I write and I'm tired of having always foregrounded "the sci-fi writer." (Page 148)
- Le Guin:
  I ask for deadlines on nonfiction. "When you want this?" But when it comes to the stuff that comes from inside me, the fiction and poetry, I demand an extraordinary and unusual amount of liberty. (Page 149)
- Le Guin:
  If a book told you something when you were fifteen, it will tell it to you again when you're fifty, though you may understand it so differently that it seems you're reading a whole new book. (Page 152)
    - Note: quoted from a previous interview in 2008
- You wrote in 1971 one of the best Phil Dick novels that Phil Dick never wrote, *The Lathe of Heaven*. (Page 153)
- Le Guin:
  The Beats weren't good to women, with their addiction scene. (Page 157)
- Le Guin:
  Robbins, who did the illustrations [for an early version of *Earthsea*], was a darling. She, and Herman, had no difficulty in understanding that __the hero Ged is not a white man__. (Page 157)
- Le Guin:
  Havnor, the capital of Earthsea, was modeled on San Francisco. (Page 158)
- Le Guin:
  I hate all back matter--"Questions for your book group" and so on. I just won't look at it. (Page 159)
- Le Guin:
  Science fiction is time-bound in a way that fantasy can be but does not need to be. (Page 160)
- Le Guin:
  What you really want is to __be your own label__. (Page 162)
    - Note: on the topic of what genre to put on her works (Lavinia, Orsinia)
- You once clarified your political stance by saying, "I am not a progressive. I think the idea of progress an invidious and generally harmful mistake. I am interested in change, which is an entirely different matter." Why is the idea of progress harmful?
  Le Guin:
  ...
  Progress discards the old, leads ever to the new, the better, the faster, the bigger, etc. You see my problem with it? It just isn't true. (Page 163)
    - Note: skipped some of her answer
- Le Guin:
  ...you just can't write for stupid people. (Page 164)
- Le Guin:
  You always hear about the westward movement. You don't hear about the backwash. Once you get to the frontier and there is no more frontier, what do you do? Well, you find a new frontier. That was talked about a lot in the 1940s, the 1950s. What is the new frontier? It's the moon, outer space. We must have a new frontier, we must go forward! It fits in with capitalism, after all. (Page 166)
- We're inundated with fantasy now.
  Le Guin: 
  But much of it is derivative; you can mash a lot of orcs and unicorns and intergalactic wars together without actually imagining anything. One of the troubles with our culture is we do not respect and train the imagination. It needs exercise. It needs practice. You can't tell a story unless you've listened to a lot of stories and then learned how to do it. (Page 167)
- Le Guin:
  To genrify is necessary. There are different genres. What is wrong is to rank them as higher or lower, to make a hierarchy based only on genre, not the quality of the writing. That is my whole argument and it goes no further. So don't try to extend it into this world. (Page 168)
    - Tags: [[definition]] 
- Le Guin:
  Can we get away from the battle metaphor, and from winning and losing? Things have changed and maybe they've changed in that perspective, and in a good direction. You talk about winning and losing. I see it as, you make a gain here and then discover you lost something there. (Page 168)
- Le Guin:
  ...it worries me when people put living people into a novel. Even when you put in rather recently dead people, it always seems you're taking a terrific risk. There's a kind of insolence about it, a kind of colonization of that person by you, the author. Is that right, is that fair? (Page 169)
- Le Guin:
  That wasn't wrong for previous generations. It is for this society. Times change.
  I can't make moral judgments about what was wrong and right a hundred or two hundred years ago. I don't live in that world. __We have so much trouble reading history without colonizing it__... (Page 169)
- Le Guin:
  ...two people can do three jobs but one person cannot do two. Well, sometimes they do, but it's a killer. (Page 173)
    - Note: talking again about about parenting and working adults
- Le Guin:
  There was one book that really took me by surprise and gave me great pleasure. It was called *The New Utopian politics of Ursula K. Le Guin's "The Dispossessed."* It came out in 2005 and practically everything in it was readable. That's very rare. (Page 178)

### Introduction
- She prided herself in having as few external stimuli as possible.
- She told an interviewer....her ideal schedule:
  5:30 a.m. -- wake up and lie there and think.
  6:15 a.m.-- get up and eat breakfast (lots).
  7:15 a.m.--get to work writing, writing, writing.
  Noon--lunch.
  1:00-3:00 p.m.--reading, music.
  3:00-5:00 p.m.--correspondence, maybe house cleaning.
  5:00-8:00 p.m.--make dinner and eat it.
  After 8:00 p.m.--I tend to be very stupid and we won't talk about this
    - Note: What if most of my work is just books, correspondence, & writing?
- [Wizard of Earthsea] taught them what they owe to the world--a reversal of most fantasy, which is about what the world owes you.
- Le Guin:
  Isn't the real question this: Is the work worth doing? Am I, a human being, __working for what I really need and want--or for what the State or advertisers tell me I want?__ Do I choose? I think that's what anarchism comes down to. Do I let my choices be made for me, and so go along with the power game, or do I choose, and accept the responsibility for my choice? In other words, am I going to be a machine-part, or a human being?
    - Note: quoting from a Jonathan Ward interview in Algol No. 24, May 1975
