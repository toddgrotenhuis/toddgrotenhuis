## Highlights
- Apart from Jesus and the good news of His atoning death and life-giving resurrection, nonviolence seems ridiculous. ([Location 234](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DHHDUY6&location=234))

- Violence is destruction to a victim by means that overpower the victim’s consent. ([Location 257](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DHHDUY6&location=257))
- By destruction they don’t mean total annihilation, but rather some sort of harm done to the person. ([Location 259](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DHHDUY6&location=259))
- a physical act that is intended to destroy (i.e., injure) a victim by means that overpower the victim’s consent. ([Location 269](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DHHDUY6&location=269))
- the military would not be funded by taxation. ([Location 853](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DHHDUY6&location=853))
- Let me make this clear: I do not think that America should use the Bible to construct or defend its military program, because America is not the new Israel, nor is it a Christian nation. ([Location 866](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DHHDUY6&location=866))
- Jesus said that the gates of hell will not prevail against God’s kingdom, and no band of terrorists, fascist government, oppressive dictator, or disarmament program will trump Jesus’s promise. ([Location 871](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DHHDUY6&location=871))
- He will win this peace by absorbing violence rather than encouraging ([Location 1536](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DHHDUY6&location=1536))
- The Messiah will absorb violence, not perpetuate it: ([Location 1546](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DHHDUY6&location=1546))
- Jesus’s kingdom was viewed as a challenge to the political and military identity of Rome. ([Location 1728](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DHHDUY6&location=1728))
- that His kingdom will not follow the script of all the other nation-like worldly kingdoms of history. ([Location 1732](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DHHDUY6&location=1732))
- Kingdom, therefore, cannot be reduced to individual salvation, or some immaterial religious experience. ([Location 1747](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DHHDUY6&location=1747))
- The crowd plays up the political nature of Jesus’s claims, which is necessary to get Him crucified—capital punishment for insurrectionists. ([Location 1754](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DHHDUY6&location=1754))
- nor is He trying to overthrow Rome. ([Location 1756](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DHHDUY6&location=1756))
    - Note: he is, but not in the way we think of
- the kingdom of God will be shaped by servitude and suffering, not human power and violence. ([Location 1820](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DHHDUY6&location=1820))
- In a world where king and kingdom were synonymous with coercion, power, and violence, Jesus’s upside-down kingdom stuck out like a baseball team with no bats, or a megachurch with no sound system or comfy chairs. But that’s precisely the point. ([Location 1824](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DHHDUY6&location=1824))
- Something is wrong when the kingdom of God is indistinguishable from that of the world. ([Location 1835](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DHHDUY6&location=1835))
- We have more in common with Christians in other nations—nations our country may war against—than we do with neighbors who share the same passport. ([Location 1837](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DHHDUY6&location=1837))
- We should never let our national citizenship take priority over our heavenly citizenship. ([Location 1848](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DHHDUY6&location=1848))
- Jesus is not just teaching people how to be better, nor is He giving them some impossible standard they’ll never live up to. The Sermon, rather, is the “definitive charter for the life of the new covenant community,” and through it Jesus seeks to sculpt counter-cultural masterpieces—citizens of the great King—to embody a different society and disclose a different God. ([Location 1930](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DHHDUY6&location=1930))
- They are to respond with unconditional, inexplicable, shocking love that comes from being redeemed by a God who loves His enemies. ([Location 1994](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DHHDUY6&location=1994))
- Jesus says to address imperialism by loving the imperialists! ([Location 2007](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DHHDUY6&location=2007))
- It’s tough to follow Jesus while clutching on to our rights, our honor, our reputation. ([Location 2010](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DHHDUY6&location=2010))
- Trying to find exceptions to the rule works against what Jesus is doing here. Jesus demands Calvary-shaped behavior that confounds and loves the enemy. ([Location 2020](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DHHDUY6&location=2020))
- Jesus advocates not for balmy passivity but for nonviolent hyperactivity soaked in stubborn love. ([Location 2023](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DHHDUY6&location=2023))
- Jesus doesn’t preach His Sermon to the Roman Empire or the American government. However, the Sermon does apply to all citizens of God’s kingdom, and it should saturate all areas of life. ([Location 2051](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DHHDUY6&location=2051))
- Jesus doesn’t give any room for obeying some bits of the Sermon, while setting aside others if your vocation demands it. ([Location 2063](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DHHDUY6&location=2063))
- even if you were the secretary of defense, if Jesus is your King, then your King says you shouldn’t retaliate, shouldn’t hate your enemy, shouldn’t confront evil with violence. ([Location 2064](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DHHDUY6&location=2064))
- Take the initiative and fight against evil—fight it by loving your enemies: ([Location 2069](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DHHDUY6&location=2069))
- There is nothing in Jesus’s words that restricts the meaning of “enemy” to certain types of people. ([Location 2085](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DHHDUY6&location=2085))
- But we shouldn’t obey Jesus’s commands about nonretaliation and enemy-love because they will always work. ([Location 2152](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DHHDUY6&location=2152))
- The Bible, however, doesn’t promote nonviolent behavior because of its effectiveness. Rather, we love our enemies and do good to those who hate us because that’s what God does. ([Location 2153](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DHHDUY6&location=2153))
- Faithfulness rather than effectiveness is our motivation. ([Location 2155](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DHHDUY6&location=2155))
- The reign of God on earth—Jesus’s kingdom—does not need military might, thick borders, superior weapons, or economic prosperity for its advancement. ([Location 2170](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DHHDUY6&location=2170))
- It’s fascinating how often citizens of God’s kingdom use the plural pronoun (we/our/us) to describe their citizenship in the earthly nation where they were born. “Our troops,” “our freedom,” “our military.” There’s actually a measure of truth in Tom’s point, but we must take out the plural pronouns to find it. “We”—if you’re a Christian—first and foremost refers to our membership in God’s kingdom, not our national identity. Passports are irrelevant in God’s kingdom. ([Location 2259](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DHHDUY6&location=2259))
- Paul never uses the plural pronoun to describe his Roman citizenship, and he discourages believers from doing the same. ([Location 2265](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DHHDUY6&location=2265))
- Later on when Paul reminds the believers that their “citizenship is in heaven,” you can hear a faint whisper of “and not in Rome.” He’s steering their patriotism away from Rome and toward Jesus. ([Location 2285](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DHHDUY6&location=2285))
- Our identity—that which marks us out as a distinct people—is with God’s kingdom, not Caesar’s. ([Location 2290](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DHHDUY6&location=2290))

- Two common titles used for the Roman emperor were lord (kurios) and savior (soter). ([Location 2300](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DHHDUY6&location=2300))
- Rome was known for securing such peace and justice through warfare. ([Location 2303](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DHHDUY6&location=2303))
- Lord, savior, son of god, god, peace, justice, and gospel. These were all familiar terms used to praise the Caesars of Rome. When Christians stole these titles and applied them to a Jew who was crucified as a revolutionary, they were bound to start a fight—especially ([Location 2305](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DHHDUY6&location=2305))
- When Paul hails Jesus as Lord and Savior, we need to hear a faint first-century echo: Caesar is not ([Location 2309](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DHHDUY6&location=2309))
- But Paul announces that Jesus is Lord and Savior. And this means that Caesar is not. ([Location 2315](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DHHDUY6&location=2315))
    - Tags: [[favorite]] 
- While Caesar Nero is revered as the exalted lord of the earth, Paul daringly wrenches the crown from Nero and places it where it belongs. On Jesus. ([Location 2337](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DHHDUY6&location=2337))
- Obey God and not people. ([Location 2349](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DHHDUY6&location=2349))
- When we are reviled and suffer unjustly, our posture should reflect Jesus. ([Location 2369](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DHHDUY6&location=2369))
- As with Jesus, nonviolent love is anything but passive. Rather, it is counter-culturally active in forgiving, honoring, blessing, and meeting the physical needs of those who can’t stand you. ([Location 2380](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DHHDUY6&location=2380))
- The New Testament is ubiquitously clear: don’t retaliate with evil for evil; do good to those who hate you; embrace your enemy with a cross-shaped, unyielding divine love. ([Location 2410](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DHHDUY6&location=2410))
- Paul’s phrase “bear the sword” (v. 4) refers to police action within a government’s jurisdiction, not warfare outside its territory. ([Location 2460](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DHHDUY6&location=2460))
- Just because God uses secular—and sometimes quite evil—institutions to carry out His will does not mean that God approves of everything they do. ([Location 2478](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DHHDUY6&location=2478))
- Romans 13 does not sanitize all governing activities. Flip through Revelation 13 and 17–18 to see that the New Testament actually condemns much of what the government does. ([Location 2492](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DHHDUY6&location=2492))
- Paul says that God executes vengeance through Rome after he prohibits Christians from doing so. ([Location 2494](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DHHDUY6&location=2494))
- In other words, Paul explicitly forbids the church in Romans 12 from doing what the government does in Romans 13. ([Location 2518](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DHHDUY6&location=2518))
- Revelation is a violent book, but as we will see, that violence is not dished out as much as it is absorbed. ([Location 2590](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DHHDUY6&location=2590))
- although there’s a lot of bloodshed, it often flows from the veins of Christ and His followers, not from His enemies. ([Location 2605](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DHHDUY6&location=2605))
- Revelation supports Christian nonviolence more aggressively than any other biblical book. ([Location 2606](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DHHDUY6&location=2606))
- Rather, the images and otherworldly scenes depict the struggle Christians face as they live within—and resist—the oppressive empires of every era. ([Location 2619](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DHHDUY6&location=2619))
- Some of these churches (Smyrna, Philadelphia) are faithful to Christ and are therefore threatened by Rome. But other churches (the other five) are faithful to Rome and are therefore threatened by the risen King! ([Location 2623](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DHHDUY6&location=2623))
- Revelation records the vision Jesus gives John, which is designed to encourage the persecuted churches and confront the compromising churches in Asia Minor. ([Location 2628](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DHHDUY6&location=2628))
- While some New Testament passages say that governing authorities reward good conduct and punish the bad (Rom. 13:1–7; see 1 Pet. 2:13–17), there’s no such positive language in the book of Revelation. None. Rome is not described as a benevolent ruler but a savage creature empowered by the Devil himself (Rev. 13:2). The state is explicitly called a “beast,” a “false prophet,” and a sensuous “whore.” All of these terms are collectively summed up by the term Babylon ([Location 2639](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DHHDUY6&location=2639))
- John uses the word differently: unlike the Roman rulers, Jesus conquers not with swords and spears but with a cross. ([Location 2671](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DHHDUY6&location=2671))
- The messianic Lion defeats evil by becoming a slaughtered Lamb. ([Location 2686](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DHHDUY6&location=2686))
- Nowhere are God’s people allowed to act violently in Revelation. ([Location 2756](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DHHDUY6&location=2756))
- God has stored up the blood of the martyrs in a massive winepress and is thrusting it down the throat of Babylon in seven bowls. ([Location 2771](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DHHDUY6&location=2771))
- If the blood was His enemies’, it would splatter on His garments after the fight, not before. ([Location 2791](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DHHDUY6&location=2791))
- And when Jesus defeats the enemy, He does so with a sword. But contrary to Driscoll, the sword comes “from his mouth,” not His hand (19:15, 21). Everywhere in Revelation, when the sword comes from the mouth, it refers to a word of judgment, not a literal sword. ([Location 2792](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DHHDUY6&location=2792))
- According to one Pakistani report, 50 civilians are killed for every terrorist. ([Location 2852](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DHHDUY6&location=2852))
- I mourn both tragedies—the death of innocent, beautiful children in Connecticut and of the precious children in the Middle East. ([Location 2868](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DHHDUY6&location=2868))
- All nations have blood on their hands. And the Lamb will make them drink it. ([Location 2873](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DHHDUY6&location=2873))
- As one of my friends joked, “It’s easy to be a pacifist in Indiana”—home of many Mennonite institutions. “Try living like that in Gaza.” ([Location 2992](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DHHDUY6&location=2992))
- While the opinions of the early church aren’t authoritative, where there is widespread agreement across different regions, we should pay special attention to what they’re saying. ([Location 3029](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DHHDUY6&location=3029))
- They all agree. Christians should never kill. Not in self-defense. Not as capital punishment for the guilty. Not in a just war. Never. ([Location 3034](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DHHDUY6&location=3034))
- whether you kill a man with a sword or a speech makes no difference, since killing itself is banned. ([Location 3065](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DHHDUY6&location=3065))
- The Roman military was inseparable from Roman religion; to serve one meant serving the other. ([Location 3098](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DHHDUY6&location=3098))
- “The Lord, by taking away Peter’s sword”—referring to the incident in Gethsemane—“disarmed every soldier thereafter.” ([Location 3111](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DHHDUY6&location=3111))
- “We are not allowed to wear any uniform that symbolizes a sinful act ([Location 3112](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DHHDUY6&location=3112))
- If everyone did what you Christians do, argued Celsus, the whole empire would collapse ([Location 3122](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DHHDUY6&location=3122))
- The state can punish enemies; the church must love them. ([Location 3141](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DHHDUY6&location=3141))

- Without the sword, the church spread. With no religious freedom, the church grew—like a mustard seed—shouldered by the stiff, persistent enemy-love of martyred saints. ([Location 3260](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DHHDUY6&location=3260))
- When early Christian writers lived with a clear separation between church and state—the kingdom of Christ and the kingdom of Caesar—they didn’t see killing for Rome (or killing for any reason) as compatible with enemy-love. ([Location 3263](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DHHDUY6&location=3263))
- when church and state became one, and the wars of Rome were waged under the banner of the cross, nonviolence became a minority view. ([Location 3268](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DHHDUY6&location=3268))
- If you haven’t been stunned by the radicalness of Jesus’s ethic in Matthew 5, and by Paul’s counter-intuitive demands of Romans 12, and by the shameful road we are called to walk according to 1 Peter 2; if you haven’t begged God for waterfalls of grace to love your local rapist who is also your enemy and desperately needs Jesus; if you aren’t perplexed at the power of martyrdom as the very means by which God conquers the Devil; if you aren’t bewildered by Jesus’s example and His insistence that you, too, turn the other cheek and never retaliate with evil for evil and forgive the one who’s beating your face in—against all human logic, against all cultural norms, against our innate sense of justice—then the cross may not appear as scandalous as it should. ([Location 3409](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DHHDUY6&location=3409))
- the question is posed in such a way as to trap people committed to nonviolence into admitting that they’re either inconsistent or heartless. ([Location 3433](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DHHDUY6&location=3433))
