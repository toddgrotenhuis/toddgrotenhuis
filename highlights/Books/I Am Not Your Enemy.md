## Highlights
### Foreword
- One of the most powerful weapons we use to dehumanize each other is the stories we believe about the other, and especially those stories that are built on fear. Such stories become fossilized in our minds and bodies to the point that we forget that stories are medicine meant to remind us that we belong to each other. More so now than ever, we need such stories to "save us from our fear"... (Page 15)
    - Note: from the Foreword by Ishmael Beah
- Through this book, we learn of the possibility of peace and of the practical requirements of forgiveness and reconciliation. Can you reconcile while injustice continues? Can you forgive those who burned down your home while still living in its ruins? (Page 16)
### Introduction
- Writing other people's stories is like walking through a minefield. This is especially true when you're a white man because white men have profited for a long time by stealing stories from other people and capitalizing on the power of those narratives. (Page 22)
- I sent each person the chapter containing their story to elicit feedback and ensure they recognized themselves in my writing and approved. Additionally, I offered honoraria from my book advance to each person whose story appears here, and am donating part of the proceeds to the three major organizations with whom I partnered while traveling. (Page 22)
- The stories we tell and the ones we listen to change us all the time, in large and little ways, and __we'd do well to consider carefully which stories win our attention__. (Page 24)
    - Tags: [[reflection]] 
- What makes for peace is the capacity to live with difference in such a way that bears fruit rather than arms. Difference and disagreement are guaranteed for human relationships. More often than not, it's how we *deal with* difference, rather than *being* different, that determines our potential to be peaceable. (Page 24)
- The stories we tell either help us or harm us. No narrative is neutral. The ones that help are usually ones that tell bold truths about our world, even painful ones, because we always need to face the truth with courage if we're to heal and grow. The ones that hurt are usually ones that distort truths-maybe to protect power, or dehumanize, or tempt us to weaponize our fear. We humans tend to do our worst when we're afraid. Fear leads to hatred and hatred leads to violence and violence leads to fear, which leads to hatred, which leads to violence. If we don't address this deadly cycle, it can loop forever. (Page 25)
- It would be untrue to say we should never be afraid. Fear is necessary. We need it to stay alive. And still, fear must be fruitful. When it's not, when it sees difference as dangerous, fear makes us into creatures of vitriol and violence. We all know this. When we're fueled by fear, we become paralyzed—or worse, *mobilized* in missions to eliminate whatever we're afraid of. With too many fear-forming stories, we may forget how to live with hope. And when hope dies, we all do. (Page 25)
- ...stories that tell counter-truths might shake our whole world. But sometimes we actually need our world to be shaken up. It can be part of what saves us. (Page 26)
- I'm reminded often of prolific novelist Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie's charge to resist "single stories": those stories that strip complexity from people and reduce them to narratives without nuance. One of the first casualties in any conflict is nuance... (Page 26)
    - Note: https://www.ted.com/talks/chimamanda_adichie_the_danger_of_a_single_story/up-next
- Wise stories, however, are those that know that someone else might tell it differently. Wise stories know there is never one villain and never one hero. Wise stories know that sometimes, maybe even most times, people can be both. Wise stories know that if you describe characters as demonic, listeners will likely long for their destruction rather than redemption. Wise stories know that the wisest stories are not told by people in power.
  Wise stories are ones that help us face the truth around us and name it for what it is. (Page 27)
- ...no good comes from doing unto others the nightmares done unto us. (Page 28)
### DIALOGUE IS NOT THE GOAL
- She's written, “This is an inappropriate conversation. We are being occupied. We should talk about justice not reconciliation." (Page 32)
- People in power prefer a victim calling for forgiveness and reconciliation to one calling for vindication. Forgiveness and reconciliation, it seems, suggest that the status quo may well endure; vindication suggests a reckoning is near. And reckonings rarely go well for those invested in nothing changing. (Page 33)
- To hear the word *reconciliation* and not imagine a radical shift in unjust power structures is to me to see reconciliation as morally bankrupt... (Page 34)
- Justice means things need to change. Reconciliation, at least the way the word is often used, means maybe everything can stay the same, as long as we're friendly. (Page 34)
- "I've learned that reconciliation efforts can be problematic if we aren't careful. There's something about the language of reconciliation that can seem friendlier to those in power and an enemy to those suffering, while language of justice may be the exact opposite. I'ye learned that if pursuits of reconciliation are not intimately tied up with works of justice, then so-called reconciliation may be unhelpful. In fact, it may actually be harmful." (Page 39)
    - Note: The author is speaking
- Knowing is very important. But what is next, in a practical way, that will serve people's life conditions? (Page 39)
- “*Dialogue* is not my goal. Dialogue is a tool, a carrier from one side's truth to a bigger truth that also includes the other side.” (Page 39)
    - Note: Palistenian speaking
- "The conflict will never change as long as we think we only need to see the humanity of each other's identity. This must happen, This is the second tum yes. But we must also change the *behavior*. It is not the *identity* of Israelis, of these settlers, that is occupying my country; it is their *behavior*." (Page 40)
    - Note: Palestinian speaking
- "Sometimes people ask me why Palestinians educate their kids to hate, which is the most—I’m sorry to say it—the most stupid question. Because if you live in such conditions, I'm not sure you need a specific curriculum for hate." (Page 41)
    - Note: Palestinian speaking
- “Peace is not to sign a piece of paper; it's to bring what is on paper to the ground. To change life conditions, to bring independence, security for both sides." (Page 43)
    - Note: Palestinian speaking
- Tremendous power imbalances are at work through the occupation. Pushing for dialogue can come dangerously close to normalizing the disparate power realities on the ground, whether intentionally or not. For a Palestinian to show up and sit side by side with an Israeli can feel as if they are supposed to pretend all is equal. Their worth as people is equal, of course, but their lived experiences of justice and freedom are not. (Page 46)
- ...dialogue as an end unto itself is an inappropriate conversation because it likely benefits only those in power. (Page 47)
- It's hard to imagine solutions together, though, if you don't agree on the problems. (Page 47)
- If pursuits of dialogue and relationship with those on the other side are not actively leading toward a secure, peaceful, just, and equitable future for all involved, then they aren't worth having. (Page 49)
### WE HAVE NO PTSD
- "but I fear they will kill us if we don't control them. It's the cost of security." (Page 52)
    - Note: Israeli speaking
      This is the start of another theme, where we look at how if people aren’t free, then we aren’t either, because we fear them.
- In conflict, it's not easy to imagine the other's life could be yours. (Page 54)
- "We promote the traditional Palestinian method of *sulha*," Usama says to me, "seeking to dismantle the occupation and secure freedom through nonviolence." (Page 55)

- Free the oppressed and you might free the oppressor too. (Page 56)
- Walls like these often rise in response to fear.... But I think walls become self-fulfilling prophecies. (Page 61)
### SOMETHING IS WOUNDED
### YOU MAY NOT KILL IN MY SON'S NAME
- Does forgiveness require reconciliation? Should the offender be remorseful to receive forgiveness? Does forgiving mean giving up your right to justice? Does forgiveness mean forgetting? (Page 80)
- “forgiving is giving up your just right to revenge” (Page 81)
    - Note: South African speaking
- “Don't kill anyone in [my son’s] name." (Page 82)
    - Note: South African speaking
- Most people like the world to be binary: You're either a perpetrator or a victim. We don't want messy ideas. Our brains are wired to sort people into categories. Early in human history, we had to do this to know whether something was friend or foe. We still do it, in lots of ways. Dichotomies are easier to engage than complexities....the world just isn't that simple....Almost always, a perpetrator was a victim first, and sometimes, victims are targeted because they were either actual or perceived perpetrators themselves.... Sometimes, victims are just victims. And sometimes, it’s more complicated than that. (Page 85)
- Building empathy for the sake of empathy, however, isn’t enough. It should lead to compassionate action for improving the world....Empathy that does not lead toward constructive efforts for personal and social improvement isn't of much use to anyone. (Page 89)
### FORTUNATELY, IT WAS PARADISE
- Abdullah smiles at me and jokes, "I built this house with Gaddafi's money," as if to say that even a dictator's money can be redeemed toward beauty. (Page 96)
- I love his answer. "I am a Christian believer," he starts, his voice full of conviction, "and my Lord told me, 'Love your enemy. I am a pacifist. I taught my children to be pacifists. I don't like bloodshed. I don't like anybody to be killed, whether Palestinian or Israeli. We are all the children of God. And I think that God loves me as he loves any Israeli. So we want to live together, side by side."
  ...
  "The only thing," Abdullah continues, "is you cannot just sit fold-handed and do nothing. You have to work for peace....The only way to live in peace is to give each one his rights.” (Page 99)
- I've never been part of anything that contained as much joy as Al Basma. It will forever hold a special place in my heart. It is where I learned that intimacy doesn't need conversation. It is where I learned the depth of forms of communication other than language, and of languages other than those spoken or written. It is where I learned that all one really needs for soul connection is presence, attention, and affection. And it's where I learned that without the ability to speak a full sentence to one another, you can build trust simply by showing up and coming back. (Page 102)
- ... religion and difference need not be markers of division. It's not written in stone anywhere that hospitality and affection shall be suspended in the company of difference. In fact, it's in the presence of difference that hospitality is often most needed. (Page 103)
### PLACE OF LUMPY CROSSINGS
- THERE'S A THEORY IN PEACEBUILDING that it can take as long to heal from a conflict as the conflict itself lasted. (Page 113)
    - Note: John Paul Lederach, "Five Qualities of Practice in Support of Reconciliation Processes," in Forgiveness and Reconciliation: Religion, Public Policy, and Conflict Transformation, ed. Raymond G. Helmick and Rodney L. Petersen iladelphia: Templeton Foundation Press, 2001), 202.
- What we must learn is that it can take as long to get out we of a conflict as it took to get in it. For simplicity's sake, if chart the duration of this "conflict" of racism only from arrival in North America of the first kidnapped Africans to the signing of the Civil Rights Act (though of course this did not actually end the scourge of racism), we can start in 1619 and drag the timeline through the centuries to 1964. That's a period of 345 years. If we were in a "post-conflict" healing journey, then we'd be only fifty years or so into a very long process. (Page 116)
- The only people who say that reconciliation is easy are people who have never done it. If reconciling across deep division were easy, it wouldn't re-traumatize people. If facilitating courageous conversations were easy, we wouldn't need trained facilitators and counselors. If transforming conflict were easy, more people would do it well. (Page 118)
- Staying in the room and trying to understand the perspectives we consider indefensible can feel wrong, because listening and learning may seem like complicity.
  ...
  Listening to understand can lead others to think you're agreeing with them. And we don't want to look complicit when it comes to the perspective of our enemies; we want to look resolute in our disdain.
  ...
  Being able to articulate the story of the other is an indispensable skill in transforming conflict into something that can help us. If we cannot summarize the other's position in a way that feels recognizable to them, we probably don't understand. Understanding their belief is not the same as justifying it, or agreeing with it, or supporting it. It's simply being able to get your head around how that person, with their story and their pain and their experiences and their relationships and their wiring, might come to think and act as they do. (Page 119)
- Sometimes the best path forward may not be searching for common ground but rather learning to live well together on the ground that we're currently on.... Where common ground can remind us of shared humanity, we should embrace it. And where it can’t, we should remember that uncommon ground is not evidence of unshared humanity. (Page 120)
- Scapegoating distracts us from the kind of deep examination and diagnosis that could lead to radical healing and change. (Page 123)
- This safe haven teaches me that we all need shelter and sanctuary in times of conflict. Seeking refuge isn't always permanent escape. Sometimes our survival depends on leaving, and the refuge may be what allows us to *return* to the sites of pain rather than abandon them. (Page 125)
- There are times when owning our victimization is necessary, when it is damning to those wielding violent power, when it can be part of what leads us toward liberation. And then there are times to let that identity go because clinging to it will only bring us back to violence. (Page 126)
- "contact hypothesis": the idea that getting proximate is the cure. But this is too limited For most of human history, you couldn't kill someone until you got close to them. Wars, prisons, and slave plantations alone are sufficient proof that meeting one another doesn't necessarily lead to peace. Sometimes, proximity may lead to deeper violence. As Corrymeela's former executive director Colin Craig said to me recently, "Sometimes, sitting with the other and hearing their story may make you say, 'Yes, now I remember *exactly* why I want to kill you.'" Corrymeela teaches me that without values and practices like curiosity and humility, proximity may just get you within firing range. (Page 126)

### I'VE JUST MET THE ENEMY
- IN THE GOSPEL OF MATTHEW, Jesus tells his disciples a story about the day of judgment. He says he will separate and judge those gathered before him on the basis of how they treated "the least of these." The most vulnerable. The undesirable. The suspicious. The people on the margins. Jesus said the judged will be told that whenever they fed the hungry, welcomed the stranger, clothed the naked, and visited the prisoner, they were actually doing those things for him. He was telling them that when he's gone, they will find him as and among "the least of these."
  I've always been struck that Jesus seems to *assume* his followers will be with such people and in such places. Like prison. (Page 135)
- We also needed a commitment to "single identity work," a phrase I encountered through studying peacebuilding. It refers to the importance of working with individual groups separately before facilitating a meeting between them....Let each group build trust and familiarity and comfort with the process before asking them to reach across the divide. (Page 138)

- ...in Hebrew and Arabic, the etymological roots of the words compassion and womb are the same. He said that just as the womb is the body's way of making space for a child, so compassion is creating space inside ourselves for another-for another's stories, identities, and feelings. (Page 141)
### WHEN RECONCILIATION MEANS NOTHING
- I've just witnessed a remarkable example of how a sincere story can land in very unexpected ways. Sometimes our best intentions can have the worst impact. The woman assumes her story is universally applicable. In reality, it doesn't even apply to the people at this table. (Page 146)
    - Note: “Things turned out great for me... I’m sure they can for you!” kind of story
- As I scanned the stone cage, I thought of how those who served as guards at the prison now find themselves on the wrong side of history. I wondered if all those serving institutions of mass incarceration will one day be scrutinized for participating in the inhumane warehousing of human lives. (Page 149)
- She tells me how despite President Mandela's long legacy of social justice and social transformation, he toned that rhetoric down during the transition out of apartheid. (Page 151)
- Reconciling relationships cannot be ignored; and it's also not enough. We cannot be interested only in forgiveness, kindness, empathy, and compassion; we must also consider things like power, generational trauma, redistribution of resources, reparations for harm, economic empowerment, and what to do with four hundred years of grieving. Advocates of reconciliation and advocates of justice must work together as colleagues, or we may, quite ironically, fight one another like enemies. (Page 152)
    - Note: Reconciliation AND justice
- "that's [economic injustices] the biggest roadblock this social inequality and injustice is presenting: it continues to dehumanize people. If you feel dehumanized all the time and you can see it being played out in ways in which your family members see themselves and their position in the world-in relation to white people, in relation to people of power-and you are fortunate to have the opportunity to interrogate these things and be able to see it for what it is: there's no way that you're not going to be angry. So this whole thing of 'black rage' that people have now come to call it, it's almost kind of a natural response." (Page 153)
    - Note: South African speaking
- “I don't think anybody should delegitimize the role the TRC played in the collective consciousness of South Africa at that time and even now. But there's never been a *real* dialogue,"
  ...White Society wanted to move on. Of course it did. Why on earth would it want to reckon with its violence? (Page 156)
- I wholeheartedly agree. This has been my sense this whole trip, seeing the tensions emerging between ideas of reconciliation and justice. They cannot exist without the other. When we think of social justice as dealing with inequality and inequity, reconciliation will sink without a foundation of social justice to stand on. (Page 157)
    - Note: Reconciliation AND justice
- "You know, here in South Africa, they call it *swart gevaar*. And *swart gevaar*, if you translate it into English, basically means 'black danger.' The 'black danger' is always the specter haunting you, and so you're never going to be free, because it's always there so long as they aren't free and aren't enjoying the same life you are."
  This language opens wide in me an understanding of own embedded racial biases. It helps me understand why I ìmmediately get nervous if l'm on a quiet street at night and a black man approaches, whereas the sight of a white man doesn't alarm me in the same way. I reason with myself quickly, but my body has already tensed. It's because the culture of white supremacy in which I've been swimming all my life has taught me an easy narrative: white people are safe; black people are not. This narrative of the dangerousness of blackness has everything to do with the abominable treatment of people of color before and since the origin of the United States. (Page 158)
    - Note: Fear because we know what’s been done to them and how we would react
- One of the first speakers was a black man I'll call Jay. He was a former police and correctional officer. Jay stood while he addressed those gathered. "We have a problem with the culture of policing," he said. "It's a scary job. I often had to walk up on houses and such, and you never know what's going to happen. You're conditioned to assume the worst. It's a very real fear and a very real threat. __The training we get trains you to be fearful of the people you're supposed to protect and serve__." In fact, I heard that day that police, on average, spend seven times as many hours training to shoot as training to deescalate. I heard that in the previous year, police killed at least two unarmed black people every week, and that black people are three times more likely to be killed by police than white people are. __"In fear," Jay said, "you don't value the person as a person; you see them as an opponent, a threat.__ And at the end of the day, I know it's highly unlikely I'll be convicted or even indicted.__We have a saying that we'd rather be tried by twelve than carried by six__.... (Page 159)
    - Note: In the USA
- I understand why people with privilege and power are afraid to engage in it. I think that __*true* reconciliation threatens the power structures__. Reconciliation needs to be dealing with creating healthy, right relationships, which must mean dealing with power imbalances. Inequality in power, access, distribution of resources—all these tear at any hope of deep relationship. If there are to be right relationships created, there must be a leveling of power. Therefore the people on top should, in a way, be nervous about this conversation, because it's going to mean giving something up. So that, to me, is the big challenge in bringing people of power and privilege into the conversation. (Page 161)
### LIKE A POISON
- ...what if every emotion exists because we need it? And what if each emotion is telling us something important about ourselves and what we need to do? (Page 169)
- I think it's important to say here that questioning the validity of generalizing a group of people is not equivalent to saying white South Africans weren't complicit in apartheid. Of course They were. They weren't all guilty in equal ways, but everyone who benefits from an unjust system and is not actively working to dismantle it is at least partly responsible for its harm. The same is true in Israel. The same is true in the United States. It’s true everywhere. (Page 171)
- His story, like those of so many others I've met, hinges on empathy. On curiosity. On staying in the room. The work of reconciliation is the work of struggling to say the difficult things to one another in such a way that you can stay in the room together. And if you must leave, reconciliation is the commitment to come back and try again.
  ...
  Any process of reconciliation that hopes to keep people in the room but doesn't address the obstacles preventing them from getting to the room in the first place is not a process worth anyone's time. (Page 172)
- Reconciliation that isn't interested in the injustices that are dividing people is shallow at best and sinister at worst, And any effort at justice that addresses the basic needs of security and sustenance but pays little attention to the quality of compassionate relationship between people is like trying to build the frame of a ship without any adhesive. (Page 174)
    - Note: Reconciliation AND justice
- "specter of black danger," the notion that white people aren't free as long as black people are consistently poor because we white folks will always be glancing over our shoulder to see if the people we and our ancestors stole from have finally come to settle up. (Page 174)
    - Tags: [[definition]] 
- We must always ask ourselves *why* we're going back to the stories of the past, because we can all put history to work for our own purposes.
  ...
  History has been used and will continue to be used as a reason to attack others and see them as targets.
  ...
  We need to be clear that we are going back to *understand* the environment and what created that situation and the choices that individuals and communities made and what the consequences were of those choices. (Page 177)
- “If you select what you want to remember, you tend to remember the bad things that were done to you, the wrongs that came your direction, rather than looking at what things *we* could've done differently. What are things that were problematic that *we* were part of as well?" (Page 178)
    - Note: South African speaking
### CRACKS OF HOPE
- "When he [Netanyahu] called her," Rami said, "she told Bibi, 'It's your fault. It's the fault of the occupation." I admire the courage of Nurit. To blame the death of your daughter on the foremost leader of your country is a bold act.
  "I think it was the first time ever," Rami continued, "that victims of terror __looked not only to the mosquito but to the swamp__." (Page 183)
- if the *soldiers believed* this story of near annihilation, their belief would continue to breed brutality. (Page 189)
- "refuseniks." These Israelis recognize the injustice of the military occupation of Palestinian land and people and therefore refuse to serve in occupied Palestine. (Page 193)
    - Tags: [[definition]] 
- "They agree about everything we say," Bassam told me. "They didn't even give me the chance to fight with them."
  ....
  Discovering that this "war criminal officer" in front of you, the man who represents all you’ve hated, is also a "very gentle man, a very kind man"—I imagine it would feel devastating. Bassam called it a "disaster." I think that's a perfect word. (Page 194)
- ...”You will never meet your daughter again, and __it will not ease your pain, even to kill the rest of the world__." (Page 196)
    - Note: Palestinian speaking
- We can ram our heads against the walls that divide us, until we put cracks in them-cracks of hope. (Page 200)
