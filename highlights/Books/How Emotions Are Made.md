## Highlights
### Introduction: The Two-Thousand-Year-Old Assumption
- The time-honored story of emotion goes something like this: We all have emotions built-in from birth. They are distinct, recognizable phenomena inside us. When something happens in the world, whether it’s a gunshot or a flirtatious glance, our emotions come on quickly and automatically, as if someone has flipped a switch. We broadcast emotions on our faces by way of smiles, frowns, scowls, and other characteristic expressions that anyone can easily recognize. Our voices reveal our emotions through laughter, shouts, and cries. Our body posture betrays our feelings with every gesture and slouch. Modern science has an account that fits this story, which I call the classical view of emotion. ([Location 62](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00QPHURT6&location=62))

- Emotions are thus thought to be a kind of brute reflex, very often at odds with our rationality. The primitive part of your brain wants you to tell your boss he’s an idiot, but your deliberative side knows that doing so would get you fired, so you restrain yourself. This kind of internal battle between emotion and reason is one of the great narratives of Western civilization. It helps define you as human. Without rationality, you are merely an emotional beast. ([Location 82](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00QPHURT6&location=82))
    - Note: But as will be shown, it’s not accurate.
- And yet . . . despite the distinguished intellectual pedigree of the classical view of emotion, and despite its immense influence in our culture and society, there is abundant scientific evidence that this view cannot possibly be true. Even after a century of effort, scientific research has not revealed a consistent, physical fingerprint for even a single emotion. ([Location 102](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00QPHURT6&location=102))
- When scientists set aside the classical view and just look at the data, a radically different explanation for emotion comes to light. In short, we find that your emotions are not built-in but made from more basic parts. They are not universal but vary from culture to culture. They are not triggered; you create them. They emerge as a combination of the physical properties of your body, a flexible brain that wires itself to whatever environment it develops in, and your culture and upbringing, which provide that environment. Emotions are real, but not in the objective sense that molecules or neurons are real. They are real in the same sense that money is real—that is, hardly an illusion, but a product of human agreement. This view, which I call the theory of constructed emotion, ([Location 110](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00QPHURT6&location=110))

### 1 The Search for Emotion’s “Fingerprints”
- Numerous experiments showed that people feel depressed when they fail to live up to their own ideals, but when they fall short of a standard set by others, they feel anxious. ([Location 174](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00QPHURT6&location=174))
- I noticed something consistently odd across all eight experiments. Many of my subjects appeared to be unwilling, or unable, to distinguish between feeling anxious and feeling depressed. Instead, they had indicated feeling both or neither; rarely did a subject report feeling just one. ([Location 183](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00QPHURT6&location=183))
- My first “botched” experiment actually revealed a genuine discovery—that people often did not distinguish between feeling anxious and feeling depressed. ([Location 189](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00QPHURT6&location=189))
- These new experiments revealed something that had never been documented before: everyone we tested used the same emotion words like “angry,” “sad,” and “afraid” to communicate their feelings but not necessarily to mean the same thing. ([Location 194](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00QPHURT6&location=194))
- A skilled interior designer can look at five shades of blue and distinguish azure, cobalt, ultramarine, royal blue, and cyan. My husband, on the other hand, would call them all blue. My students and I had discovered a similar phenomenon for emotions, which I described as emotional granularity.2 ([Location 200](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00QPHURT6&location=200))
    - Tags: [[definition]] 
- Back in the 1960s, the psychologist Silvan S. Tomkins and his protégés Carroll E. Izard and Paul Ekman decided to test this in the lab. They created sets of meticulously posed photographs, such as those in figure 1-2, to represent six so-called basic emotions they believed had biological fingerprints: anger, fear, disgust, surprise, sadness, and happiness. ([Location 236](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00QPHURT6&location=236))
- This research technique—let’s call it the basic emotion method—revolutionized the scientific study of what Tomkins’s group called “emotion recognition.” Using this method, scientists showed that people from around the world could consistently match the same emotion words (translated into the local language) to posed faces. ([Location 254](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00QPHURT6&location=254))
    - Tags: [[definition]] 
- A more objective technique, called facial electromyography (EMG), removes human perceivers altogether. Facial EMG places electrodes on the surface of the skin to detect the electrical signals that make facial muscles move. It precisely identifies the parts of the face as they move, how much, and how often. ([Location 264](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00QPHURT6&location=264))
    - Tags: [[definition]] 
- As it turns out, facial EMG presents a serious challenge to the classical view of emotion. In study after study, the muscle movements do not reliably indicate when someone is angry, sad, or fearful; they don’t form predictable fingerprints for each emotion. At best, facial EMG reveals that these movements distinguish pleasant versus unpleasant feeling. Even more damning, the facial movements recorded in these studies do not reliably match the posed photos created for the basic emotion method. ([Location 271](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00QPHURT6&location=271))
- It’s conceivable that facial EMG is too limited to capture all the meaningful actions in a face during an emotional experience. A scientist can place about six electrodes on each side of the face before a test subject starts to feel uncomfortable, too few to capture all forty-two facial muscles meaningfully. So scientists also employ an alternative technique called facial action coding (FACS), in which trained observers laboriously classify a subject’s individual facial movements as they occur. It’s less objective than facial EMG, since it relies on human perceivers, but presumably more objective than matching words to posed faces in the basic emotion method. Nevertheless, the movements observed during facial action coding also don’t consistently match the posed photos. ([Location 282](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00QPHURT6&location=282))

- when scientists observe infants in situations that should evoke emotion, the infants do not make the expected expressions. ([Location 290](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00QPHURT6&location=290))
- Faces are constantly moving, and your brain relies on many different factors at once—body posture, voice, the overall situation, your lifetime of experience—to figure out which movements are meaningful and what they mean. ([Location 303](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00QPHURT6&location=303))
- This sort of variation held true for every emotion that we studied. An emotion like “Fear” does not have a single expression but a diverse population of facial movements that vary from one situation to the next.* ([Location 324](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00QPHURT6&location=324))
- happiness, sadness, anger, and every other emotion you know is a diverse category, with widely varying facial movements. ([Location 331](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00QPHURT6&location=331))
- Some facial movements have meaning, but others do not, and right now, we know precious little about how people figure out which is which, other than that context is somehow crucial ([Location 340](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00QPHURT6&location=340))
- The idea that a posed, so-called facial expression can trigger an emotional state is known as the facial feedback hypothesis. ([Location 358](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00QPHURT6&location=358))
    - Tags: [[definition]] 
- The facial feedback hypothesis is highly controversial—there is wide disagreement on whether a full-blown emotional experience can be evoked this way. ([Location 361](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00QPHURT6&location=361))
- The 1983 study did, in fact, observe bodily changes as people posed the required facial configurations. This is a remarkable finding: just posing a particular facial configuration changed the test subjects’ peripheral nervous system activity, even while they were comfortably motionless in a chair. ([Location 363](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00QPHURT6&location=363))
- Even small changes in body posture, like lying back versus leaning forward with arms crossed, can completely alter an angry person’s physiological response.27 ([Location 401](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00QPHURT6&location=401))
- What does it mean that four meta-analyses, summarizing hundreds of experiments, revealed no consistent, specific fingerprints in the autonomic nervous system for different emotions? It doesn’t mean that emotions are an illusion, or that bodily responses are random. It means that on different occasions, in different contexts, in different studies, within the same individual and across different individuals, the same emotion category involves different bodily responses. ([Location 413](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00QPHURT6&location=413))
- Despite tremendous time and investment, research has not revealed a consistent bodily fingerprint for even a single emotion. ([Location 418](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00QPHURT6&location=418))
- an emotion is not a thing but a category of instances, and any emotion category has tremendous variety. ([Location 421](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00QPHURT6&location=421))
- as I considered emotion categories in all their diversity, I was unwittingly applying a standard way of thinking in biology called population thinking, which was proposed by Darwin. A category, such as a species of animal, is a population of unique members who vary from one another, with no fingerprint at their core. The category can be described at the group level only in abstract, statistical terms. ([Location 430](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00QPHURT6&location=430))
    - Tags: [[definition]] 
- What we have been calling a fingerprint might just be a stereotype.29 ([Location 434](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00QPHURT6&location=434))
- a mental event, such as fear, is not created by only one set of neurons. Instead, combinations of different neurons can create instances of fear. Neuroscientists call this principle degeneracy. Degeneracy means “many to one”: many combinations of neurons can produce the same outcome. ([Location 482](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00QPHURT6&location=482))
    - Tags: [[definition]] 
- many parts of the brain serve more than one purpose. The brain contains core systems that participate in creating a wide variety of mental states. A single core system can play a role in thinking, remembering, decision-making, seeing, hearing, and experiencing and perceiving diverse emotions. A core system is “one to many”: a single brain area or network contributes to many different mental states. ([Location 491](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00QPHURT6&location=491))
    - Tags: [[definition]] 
- Some of these scientists claim that the statistical summaries depict neural fingerprints for anger and fear. But that’s a gigantic logical error. The statistical pattern for fear is not an actual brain state, just an abstract summary of many instances of fear. These scientists are mistaking a mathematical average for the norm. ([Location 568](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00QPHURT6&location=568))
- When properly applied, pattern classification is an example of population thinking. ([Location 576](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00QPHURT6&location=576))
### 2 Emotions Are Constructed
- If this is your first time viewing these blobs, your brain is working hard to make sense of them. Neurons in your visual cortex are processing the lines and edges. Your amygdala is firing rapidly because the input is novel. Other brain regions are sifting through your past experiences to determine if you’ve encountered anything like this input before and are conversing with your body to prepare it for an as-yet-undetermined action. Most likely, you are in a state called experiential blindness, seeing only black blobs of unknown origin. ([Location 590](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00QPHURT6&location=590))
    - Tags: [[definition]] 
- We will call it simulation. It means that your brain changed the firing of its own sensory neurons in the absence of incoming sensory input. Simulation can be visual, as with our picture, or involve any of your other senses. ([Location 606](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00QPHURT6&location=606))
    - Tags: [[definition]] 
- Simulations are your brain’s guesses of what’s happening in the world. In every waking moment, you’re faced with ambiguous, noisy information from your eyes, ears, nose, and other sensory organs. Your brain uses your past experiences to construct a hypothesis—the simulation—and compares it to the cacophony arriving from your senses. In this manner, simulation lets your brain impose meaning on the noise, selecting what’s relevant and ignoring the rest. ([Location 625](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00QPHURT6&location=625))
- Scientific evidence shows that what we see, hear, touch, taste, and smell are largely simulations of the world, not reactions to it. ([Location 629](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00QPHURT6&location=629))
- Each time your brain simulates sensory input, it prepares automatic changes in your body that have the potential to change your feeling. ([Location 639](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00QPHURT6&location=639))
- Your concepts are a primary tool for your brain to guess the meaning of incoming sensory inputs. ([Location 650](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00QPHURT6&location=650))
- Every moment that you are alive, your brain uses concepts to simulate the outside world. Without concepts, you are experientially blind, as you were with the blobby bee. With concepts, your brain simulates so invisibly and automatically that vision, hearing, and your other senses seem like reflexes rather than constructions. ([Location 663](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00QPHURT6&location=663))
- Now consider this: what if your brain uses this same process to make meaning of the sensations from inside your body—the commotion arising from your heartbeat, breathing, and other internal movements? ([Location 665](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00QPHURT6&location=665))
- In a given moment, in a given context, your brain uses concepts to give meaning to internal sensations as well as to external sensations from the world, all simultaneously. From an aching stomach, your brain constructs an instance of hunger, nausea, or mistrust. ([Location 672](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00QPHURT6&location=672))
- In these cases of disgust, longing, and anxiety, the concept active in your brain is an emotion concept. As before, your brain makes meaning from your aching stomach, together with the sensations from the world around you, by constructing an instance of that concept. An instance of emotion. And that just might be how emotions are made. ([Location 677](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00QPHURT6&location=677))
    - Tags: [[definition]] 
- An emotion is your brain’s creation of what your bodily sensations mean, in relation to what is going on around you in the world. ([Location 687](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00QPHURT6&location=687))
- as you will learn, however, neuroscience now shows us how this process—and much more—occurs in the brain to make an emotion on the spot. I call this explanation the theory of constructed emotion: 
  In every waking moment, your brain uses past experience, organized as concepts, to guide your actions and give your sensations meaning. When the concepts involved are emotion concepts, your brain constructs instances of emotion. ([Location 689](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00QPHURT6&location=689))
    - Tags: [[definition]] 
- Emotions are not reactions to the world. You are not a passive receiver of sensory input but an active constructor of your emotions. From sensory input and past experience, your brain constructs meaning and prescribes action. If you didn’t have concepts that represent your past experience, all your sensory inputs would just be noise. You wouldn’t know what the sensations are, what caused them, nor how to behave to deal with them. With concepts, your brain makes meaning of sensation, and sometimes that meaning is an emotion. ([Location 705](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00QPHURT6&location=705))
- The theory of constructed emotion belongs to a broader scientific tradition called construction, which holds that your experiences and behaviors are created in the moment by biological processes within your brain and body. ([Location 724](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00QPHURT6&location=724))
- But particular concepts like “Anger” and “Disgust” are not genetically predetermined. Your familiar emotion concepts are built-in only because you grew up in a particular social context where those emotion concepts are meaningful and useful, and your brain applies them outside your awareness to construct your experiences. Heart rate changes are inevitable; their emotional meaning is not. ([Location 735](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00QPHURT6&location=735))
- social construction theories ask how feelings and perceptions are influenced by our social roles or beliefs. ([Location 743](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00QPHURT6&location=743))
    - Tags: [[definition]] 
- Another flavor of construction, known as psychological construction, turns this focus inward. It proposes that your perceptions, thoughts, and feelings are themselves constructed from more basic parts. ([Location 749](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00QPHURT6&location=749))
    - Tags: [[definition]] 
- these same principles of construction appear to hold for the brain’s physical architecture, an idea called neuroconstruction. ([Location 761](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00QPHURT6&location=761))
    - Tags: [[definition]] 
- In other words, construction extends all the way down to the cellular level. The macro structure of your brain is largely predetermined, but the microwiring is not. As a consequence, past experience helps determine your future experiences and perceptions. ([Location 767](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00QPHURT6&location=767))
- The theory of constructed emotion incorporates elements of all three flavors of construction. From social construction, it acknowledges the importance of culture and concepts. From psychological construction, it considers emotions to be constructed by core systems in the brain and body. And from neuroconstruction, it adopts the idea that experience wires the brain. ([Location 772](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00QPHURT6&location=772))
- This phenomenon is our old friend degeneracy at work: different instances of fear are constructed by different combinations of the core systems throughout the brain. We can describe the instances of fear together by a pattern of brain activity, but this pattern is a statistical summary and need not describe any actual instance of fear. ([Location 802](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00QPHURT6&location=802))
- Holism, emergent properties, and degeneracy are the very antithesis of fingerprints. ([Location 833](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00QPHURT6&location=833))
- the Dutch concept Gezellig (a specific experience of comfort with friends), which has no exact English translation. ([Location 845](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00QPHURT6&location=845))
- social reality: when objects in the physical world, like baked goods, take on additional functions by social agreement. Likewise, emotions are social reality. ([Location 850](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00QPHURT6&location=850))
    - Tags: [[definition]] 
- Social reality is not just about words—it gets under your skin. If you perceive the same baked good as a decadent “cupcake” or a healthful “muffin,” research suggests that your body metabolizes it differently. Likewise, the words and concepts of your culture help to shape your brain wiring and your physical changes during emotion. ([Location 855](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00QPHURT6&location=855))
- I coined a more neutral term, facial configuration, because the English language has no word for “the set of facial muscle movements that the classical view treats as a coordinated unit.” ([Location 861](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00QPHURT6&location=861))
    - Tags: [[definition]] 
- When you construct an emotional experience of your own, I call it an instance of emotion. ([Location 863](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00QPHURT6&location=863))
    - Tags: [[definition]] 
- I refer to fear, anger, happiness, sadness, and so on, in general as emotion categories, because each word names a population of diverse instances, ([Location 864](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00QPHURT6&location=864))
    - Tags: [[definition]] 
- Likewise, we do not “recognize” or “detect” emotions in others. These terms imply that an emotion category has a fingerprint that exists in nature, independent of any perceiver, waiting to be found. Any scientific question about “detecting” emotion automatically presumes a certain kind of answer. In the construction mindset, I speak of perceiving an instance of emotion. ([Location 868](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00QPHURT6&location=868))
- I also avoid verbs like “triggering” emotion, and phrases like “emotional reaction” and emotions “happening to you.” Such wording implies that emotions are objective entities. Even when you feel no sense of agency when experiencing emotion, which is most of the time, you are an active participant in that experience. ([Location 871](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00QPHURT6&location=871))
- I also do not speak of perceiving someone’s emotion “accurately.” Instances of emotion have no objective fingerprints in the face, body, and brain, so “accuracy” has no scientific meaning. It has a social meaning—we certainly can ask whether two people agree in their perceptions of emotion, or whether a perception is consistent with some norm. But perceptions exist within the perceiver. ([Location 874](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00QPHURT6&location=874))
    - Tags: [[favorite]] 
- No scientific innovation will miraculously reveal a biological fingerprint of any emotion. That’s because our emotions aren’t built-in, waiting to be revealed. They are made. By us. We don’t recognize emotions or identify emotions: we construct our own emotional experiences, and our perceptions of others’ emotions, on the spot, as needed, through a complex interplay of systems. ([Location 884](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00QPHURT6&location=884))
### 3 The Myth of Universal Emotions
- Because the short list of emotion words in the basic emotion method—a technique called a forced choice—is an unintentional cheat sheet for the test subjects. ([Location 950](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00QPHURT6&location=950))
    - Tags: [[definition]] 
- The words not only limit the available choices but also prompt the subjects to simulate facial configurations for the corresponding emotion concepts, preparing them to see certain emotions and not others. This process is called priming. ([Location 951](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00QPHURT6&location=951))
    - Tags: [[definition]] 
- And consider this fun fact: the historical record implies that ancient Romans did not smile spontaneously when they were happy. The word “smile” doesn’t even exist in Latin. Smiling was an invention of the Middle Ages, and broad, toothy-mouthed smiles (with crinkling at the eyes, named the Duchenne smile by Ekman) became popular only in the eighteenth century as dentistry became more accessible and affordable. ([Location 1049](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00QPHURT6&location=1049))
- Given how easy it is to teach emotion concepts by accident, there is also a danger in using Western stereotypes of emotion in cultural research. ([Location 1113](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00QPHURT6&location=1113))
- In the long run, scientists who still subscribe to the basic emotion method are very likely helping to create the universality that they believe they are discovering. ([Location 1119](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00QPHURT6&location=1119))
- We can also try to understand why people hold stereotypes about facial configurations in the first place, and what their value might be. ([Location 1132](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00QPHURT6&location=1132))
### 4 The Origin of Feeling
- Simple pleasant and unpleasant feelings come from an ongoing process inside you called interoception. Interoception is your brain’s representation of all sensations from your internal organs and tissues, the hormones in your blood, and your immune system. ([Location 1151](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00QPHURT6&location=1151))
    - Tags: [[definition]] 
- the science behind interoception, grounded in the wiring of your brain, will help you see yourself in a new light. It also demonstrates that you’re not at the mercy of emotions that arise unbidden to control your behavior. You are an architect of these experiences. Your river of feelings might feel like it’s flowing over you, but actually you’re the river’s source. ([Location 1163](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00QPHURT6&location=1163))
- Your brain’s 86 billion neurons, which are connected into massive networks, never lie dormant awaiting a jump-start. Your neurons are always stimulating each other, sometimes millions at a time. Given enough oxygen and nutrients, these huge cascades of stimulation, known as intrinsic brain activity, continue from birth until death. This activity is nothing like a reaction triggered by the outside world. It’s more like breathing, a process that requires no external catalyst. ([Location 1177](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00QPHURT6&location=1177))
    - Tags: [[definition]] 
- The intrinsic activity in your brain is not random; it is structured by collections of neurons that consistently fire together, called intrinsic networks. These networks operate somewhat like sports teams. A team has a pool of players; at any given moment, some players are in the game and others sit on the bench, ready to jump in when needed. Likewise, an intrinsic network has a pool of available neurons. Each time the network does its job, different groupings of its neurons play (fire) in synchrony to fill all the necessary positions on the team. ([Location 1181](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00QPHURT6&location=1181))
    - Tags: [[definition]] 
- intrinsic brain activity is the origin of dreams, daydreams, imagination, mind wandering, and reveries, which we collectively called simulation in chapter 2. It also ultimately produces every sensation you experience, including your interoceptive sensations, which are the origins of your most basic pleasant, unpleasant, calm, and jittery feelings. ([Location 1188](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00QPHURT6&location=1188))
- Prediction is such a fundamental activity of the human brain that some scientists consider it the brain’s primary mode of operation. ([Location 1211](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00QPHURT6&location=1211))
- Predictions not only anticipate sensory input from outside the skull but explain it. ([Location 1213](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00QPHURT6&location=1213))
- One human retina transmits as much visual data as a fully loaded computer network connection in every waking moment; now multiply that by every sensory pathway you have. ([Location 1231](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00QPHURT6&location=1231))
- You might think that your perceptions of the world are driven by events in the world, but really, they are anchored in your predictions, which are then tested against those little skipping stones of incoming sensory input.14 ([Location 1241](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00QPHURT6&location=1241))
- Through prediction and correction, your brain continually creates and revises your mental model of the world. It’s a huge, ongoing simulation that constructs everything you perceive while determining how you act. ([Location 1250](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00QPHURT6&location=1250))
- Your brain’s colossal, ongoing storm of predictions and corrections can be thought of as billions of tiny droplets. Each little drop represents a certain wiring arrangement that I’ll call a prediction loop, shown in figure 4-2. This arrangement holds at many levels throughout your entire brain. Neurons participate in prediction loops with other neurons. Brain regions participate in prediction loops with other regions. Your multitudes of prediction loops run in a massive parallel process that continues nonstop for your whole life, creating the sights, sounds, smells, tastes, and touches that make up your experiences and dictate your actions. ([Location 1263](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00QPHURT6&location=1263))
- Figure 4-2: Structure of a prediction loop. Predictions become simulations of sensations and movement. These simulations are compared to actual sensory input from the world. If they match, the predictions are correct and the simulation becomes your experience. If they don’t match, your brain must resolve the errors. ([Location 1269](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00QPHURT6&location=1269))
- As you can see, in many cases, the outside world is irrelevant to your experience. In a sense, your brain is wired for delusion: through continual prediction, you experience a world of your own creation that is held in check by the sensory world. Once your predictions are correct enough, they not only create your perception and action but also explain the meaning of your sensations. This is your brain’s default mode. And marvelously, your brain does not just predict the future: it can imagine the future at will. As far as we know, no other animal brain can do that. ([Location 1313](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00QPHURT6&location=1313))
- From your brain’s point of view, locked inside the skull, your body is just another part of the world that it must explain. ([Location 1330](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00QPHURT6&location=1330))
- Your brain must explain bodily sensations to make them meaningful, and its major tool for doing so is prediction. So, your brain models the world from the perspective of someone with your body. Just as your brain predicts the sights, smells, sounds, touches, and tastes from the world in relation to the movements of your head and limbs, it also predicts the sensory consequences of movements inside your body.21 ([Location 1333](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00QPHURT6&location=1333))
- Usually, you experience interoception only in general terms: those simple feelings of pleasure, displeasure, arousal, or calmness that I mentioned earlier. Sometimes, however, you experience moments of intense interoceptive sensations as emotions. That is a key element of the theory of constructed emotion. In every waking moment, your brain gives your sensations meaning. Some of those sensations are interoceptive sensations, and the resulting meaning can be an instance of emotion. ([Location 1340](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00QPHURT6&location=1340))
- Interoception is actually a whole-brain process, but several regions work together in a special way that is critical for interoception. My lab has discovered that these regions form an interoceptive network that is intrinsic in your brain, analogous to your networks for vision, hearing, and other senses. The interoceptive network issues predictions about your body, tests the resulting simulations against sensory input from your body, and updates your brain’s model of your body in the world. ([Location 1345](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00QPHURT6&location=1345))

- I’ll describe this network as having two general parts with distinct roles. One part is a set of brain regions that send predictions to the body to control its internal environment: speed up the heart, slow down breathing, release more cortisol, metabolize more glucose, and so on. We’ll call them your body-budgeting regions.* The second part is a region that represents sensations inside your body, called your primary interoceptive cortex.26 ([Location 1349](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00QPHURT6&location=1349))
    - Tags: [[definition]] 
- The two parts of your interoceptive network participate in a prediction loop. Each time your body-budgeting regions predict a motor change, like speeding up the heart, they also predict the sensory consequences of that change, like a pounding feeling in your chest. These sensory predictions are called interoceptive predictions, and they flow to your primary interoceptive cortex, where they are simulated in the usual way. Primary interoceptive cortex also receives sensory inputs from the heart, lungs, kidneys, skin, muscles, blood vessels, and other organs and tissue as they perform their usual duties. The neurons in your primary interoceptive cortex compare the simulation to the incoming sensory input, computing any relevant prediction error, completing the loop, and ultimately creating interoceptive sensations.

- Why is this relevant to emotion? Because every brain region that’s claimed to be a home of emotion in humans is a body-budgeting region within the interoceptive network. These regions, however, don’t react in emotion. They don’t react at all. They predict, intrinsically, to regulate your body budget. They issue predictions for sights, sounds, thoughts, memories, imagination, and, yes, emotions. The idea of an emotional brain region is an illusion caused by the outdated belief in a reactive brain. ([Location 1371](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00QPHURT6&location=1371))
- People call cortisol a “stress hormone,” but this is a mistake. Cortisol is released whenever you need a surge of energy, which happens to include the times when you are stressed. Its main purpose is to flood the bloodstream with glucose to provide immediate energy to cells, ([Location 1379](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00QPHURT6&location=1379))

- Withdrawals from your body’s budget don’t require actual physical movement. Suppose you see your boss, teacher, or baseball coach walking toward you. You believe that she judges everything you say and do. Even though no physical movement seems called for, your brain predicts that your body needs energy and makes a budget withdrawal, releasing cortisol and flooding glucose into your bloodstream. You also have a surge in interoceptive sensations. Stop and think about this for a minute. Someone merely walks toward you while you are standing still, and your brain predicts that you need fuel! In this manner, any event that significantly impacts your body budget becomes personally meaningful to you. ([Location 1385](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00QPHURT6&location=1385))
- To perturb your budget, you don’t even require another person or object to be present. You can just imagine your boss, teacher, coach, or anything else relevant to you. Every simulation, whether it becomes an emotion or not, impacts your body budget. As it turns out, people spend at least half their waking hours simulating rather than paying attention to the world around them, and this pure simulation strongly drives their feelings. ([Location 1406](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00QPHURT6&location=1406))
    - Note: Makes me wonder if part of the benefit of mindfulness training is in reducing this “waste”?
- When it comes to managing your body budget, your brain does not have to go it alone. Other people regulate your body budget too. When you interact with your friends, parents, children, lovers, teammates, therapist, or other close companions, you and they synchronize breathing, heart beats, and other physical signals, leading to tangible benefits. Holding hands with loved ones, or even keeping their photo on your desk at work, reduces activation in your body-budgeting regions and makes you less bothered by pain. If you’re standing at the bottom of a hill with friends, it will appear less steep and easier to climb than if you are alone. If you grow up in poverty, a situation that leads to chronic body-budget imbalance and an overactive immune system, these body-budgeting problems are reduced if you have a supportive person in your life. In contrast, when you lose a close, loving relationship and feel physically ill about it, part of the reason is that your loved one is no longer helping to regulate your budget. You feel like you’ve lost a part of yourself because, in a sense, you have. ([Location 1410](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00QPHURT6&location=1410))
- Every person you encounter, every prediction you make, every idea you imagine, and every sight, sound, taste, touch, and smell that you fail to anticipate all have budgetary consequences and corresponding interoceptive predictions.

- Calm? Interested? Energetic? Bored? Tired? Cranky? These are the simple feelings we discussed at the beginning of the chapter. Scientists call them affect.* Affect is the general sense of feeling that you experience throughout each day. It is not emotion but a much simpler feeling with two features. ([Location 1426](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00QPHURT6&location=1426))
    - Tags: [[definition]] 
- The first is how pleasant or unpleasant you feel, which scientists call valence. ([Location 1429](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00QPHURT6&location=1429))
    - Tags: [[definition]] 
- The second feature of affect is how calm or agitated you feel, which is called arousal. ([Location 1431](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00QPHURT6&location=1431))

- Even a completely neutral feeling is affect. ([Location 1434](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00QPHURT6&location=1434))
- Affect, you may recall, depends on interoception. That means affect is a constant current throughout your life, even when you are completely still or asleep. ([Location 1438](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00QPHURT6&location=1438))
- when your brain represents interoceptive changes, you experience pleasantness and unpleasantness, and agitation and calmness. ([Location 1441](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00QPHURT6&location=1441))
- Your affective feelings of pleasure and displeasure, and calmness and agitation, are simple summaries of your budgetary state. ([Location 1447](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00QPHURT6&location=1447))
- When your budget is unbalanced, your affect doesn’t instruct you how to act in any specific way, but it prompts your brain to search for explanations. Your brain constantly uses past experience to predict which objects and events will impact your body budget, changing your affect. These objects and events are collectively your affective niche. Intuitively, your affective niche includes everything that has any relevance to your body budget in the present moment.

- When you experience affect without knowing the cause, you are more likely to treat affect as information about the world, rather than your experience of the world. ([Location 1477](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00QPHURT6&location=1477))
- The psychologist Gerald L. Clore has spent decades performing clever experiments to better understand how people make decisions every day based on gut feelings. This phenomenon is called affective realism, because we experience supposed facts about the world that are created in part by our feelings. ([Location 1478](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00QPHURT6&location=1478))

- Affect leads us to believe that objects and people in the world are inherently negative or positive.* ([Location 1485](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00QPHURT6&location=1485))
- The phrase “an unpleasant image” is really shorthand for “an image that impacts my body budget, producing sensations that I experience as unpleasant.” In these moments of affective realism, we experience affect as a property of an object or event in the outside world, rather than as our own experience. ([Location 1487](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00QPHURT6&location=1487))
- a bad feeling doesn’t always mean something is wrong. It just means you’re taxing your body budget. ([Location 1497](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00QPHURT6&location=1497))
- Many factors may contribute to these tragedies, ranging from carelessness to racial bias, but it is also possible that some of the shooters actually perceive a weapon when none is present due to affective realism in a high-pressure and dangerous context.* The human brain is wired for this sort of delusion, in part because moment-to-moment interoception infuses us with affect, which we then use as evidence about the world. ([Location 1510](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00QPHURT6&location=1510))
- People like to say that seeing is believing, but affective realism demonstrates that believing is seeing. The world often takes a backseat to your predictions. ([Location 1514](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00QPHURT6&location=1514))
- Remember when I compared your brain to a scientist who makes and tests hypotheses? Your body-budgeting regions are like a mostly deaf scientist: they make predictions but have a hard time listening to the incoming evidence. ([Location 1527](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00QPHURT6&location=1527))
- In short, you feel what your brain believes. Affect primarily comes from prediction. ([Location 1541](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00QPHURT6&location=1541))
- You might think that in everyday life, the things you see and hear influence what you feel, but it’s mostly the other way around: that what you feel alters your sight and hearing. Interoception in the moment is more influential to perception, and how you act, than the outside world is. ([Location 1566](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00QPHURT6&location=1566))
- Even when you experience yourself as rational, your body budget and its links to affect are there, lurking beneath the surface. ([Location 1592](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00QPHURT6&location=1592))
- If the idea of the rational human mind is so toxic to the economy, and it’s not backed up by neuroscience, why does it persist? Because we humans have long believed that rationality makes us special in the animal kingdom. ([Location 1594](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00QPHURT6&location=1594))
- This illusory arrangement of layers, which is sometimes called the “triune brain,” remains one of the most successful misconceptions in human biology. ([Location 1601](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00QPHURT6&location=1601))

- The bottom line is this: the human brain is anatomically structured so that no decision or action can be free of interoception and affect, no matter what fiction people tell themselves about how rational they are. Your bodily feeling right now will project forward to influence what you will feel and do in the future. It is an elegantly orchestrated, self-fulfilling prophecy, embodied within the architecture of your brain. ([Location 1611](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00QPHURT6&location=1611))
- A visual prediction, for example, doesn’t just answer the question, “What did I see last time I was in this situation?” It answers, “What did I see last time I was in this situation when my body was in this state?” ([Location 1618](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00QPHURT6&location=1618))
- Affect is your brain’s best guess about the state of your body budget. ([Location 1621](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00QPHURT6&location=1621))
- Consider this: Your interceptive predictions, which produce your feelings of affect, determine what you care about in the moment—your affective niche. From the perspective of your brain, anything in your affective niche could potentially influence your body budget, and nothing else in the universe matters. That means, in effect, that you construct the environment in which you live. ([Location 1623](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00QPHURT6&location=1623))
