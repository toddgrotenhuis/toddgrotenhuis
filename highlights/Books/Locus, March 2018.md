## Highlights
- Her writing was fierce, insightful, brilliant, and humane
- The first two books were adapted for a TV mini-series in 2004, the result of which so appalled Le Guin that she published essay ‘‘A Whitewashed Earthsea – How the Sci Fi Channel Wrecked My Books’’. She was also disappointed in the animated adaptation Tales From Earthsea (2005).
- Ursula could be irritated by people and events, and she was often direct and honest in ways that belied her place of honor as a sacred object.
- although Ursula looked like a mild-mannered woman of ineffable competence, she was in fact a wolverine, and as passionate and fierce in defense of her friends and their ideas as she was of her own
- Read her work, and notice the way in which she held ideas sharp as stilettos about the nature of humanity and of racism, sexism, and capitalism, while being regarded by much of the literary community as a congenial and beloved writer of popular fantasy. Both are true: the one does not contradict the other.
    - Note: Referring to Ursula K LeGuin
- the question isn’t, ‘‘Should we use technology?’’ but rather, ‘‘Which technology should we use?’’
- If the Supreme Court’s Citizens United decision has you convinced that money has had a corrupting influence on who gets to speak, imagine how corrupting the situation would be if you also had to pay to listen.
- Corporations – artificial persons under the law – are colony life-forms that use us like gut-flora, maneuvering us to help them thrive and reproduce, jettisoning us or crushing us if we cease to serve their needs.
