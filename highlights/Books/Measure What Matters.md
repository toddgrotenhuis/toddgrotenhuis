## Highlights
### 1 Google, Meet OKRs
- OKRs: “A management methodology that helps to ensure that the company focuses efforts on the same important issues throughout the organization.” ([Location 172](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078FZ9SYB&location=172))
- By definition, objectives are significant, concrete, action oriented, and (ideally) inspirational. ([Location 173](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078FZ9SYB&location=173))
- KEY RESULTS benchmark and monitor HOW we get to the objective. ([Location 175](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078FZ9SYB&location=175))
- Effective KRs are specific and time-bound, aggressive yet realistic. Most of all, they are measurable and verifiable. ([Location 175](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078FZ9SYB&location=175))
- Where an objective can be long-lived, rolled over for a year or longer, key results evolve as the work progresses. Once they are all completed, the objective is necessarily achieved. ([Location 179](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078FZ9SYB&location=179))
- OKRs surface your primary goals. They channel efforts and coordination. They link diverse operations, lending purpose and unity to the entire organization. ([Location 188](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078FZ9SYB&location=188))
- They even posted a warning label: “Goals may cause systematic problems in organizations due to narrowed focus, unethical behavior, increased risk taking, decreased cooperation, and decreased motivation.” ([Location 194](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078FZ9SYB&location=194))
- Like any management system, OKRs may be executed well or badly; the aim of this book is to help you use them well. ([Location 202](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078FZ9SYB&location=202))
- “hard goals” drive performance more effectively than easy goals. Second, specific hard goals “produce a higher level of output” than vaguely worded ones. ([Location 205](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078FZ9SYB&location=205))
- Among experiments in the field, 90 percent confirm that productivity is enhanced by well-defined, challenging goals. ([Location 208](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078FZ9SYB&location=208))
- A two-year Deloitte study found that no single factor has more impact than “clearly defined goals that are written down and shared freely. . . . Goals create alignment, clarity, and job satisfaction.” ([Location 215](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078FZ9SYB&location=215))
- OKRs are Swiss Army knives, suited to any environment. ([Location 239](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078FZ9SYB&location=239))
- By enabling frontline autonomy, they give rise to fresh solutions. ([Location 248](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078FZ9SYB&location=248))
- In Google’s early years, Larry Page set aside two days per quarter to personally scrutinize the OKRs for each and every software engineer. ([Location 257](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078FZ9SYB&location=257))
- As the company expanded, Larry continued to kick off each quarter with a marathon debate on his leadership team’s objectives. ([Location 259](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078FZ9SYB&location=259))
- Bottom-up OKRs work hand in glove with “20 percent time,” which frees grassroots engineers to dive into promising side projects. ([Location 266](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078FZ9SYB&location=266))
- The higher the ratio of reports, the flatter the org chart—which means less top-down oversight, greater frontline autonomy, and more fertile soil for the next breakthrough. OKRs help make all of these good things possible. ([Location 268](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078FZ9SYB&location=268))
- whatmatters.com—is ([Location 288](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078FZ9SYB&location=288))
- Acute focus, open sharing, exacting measurement, a license to shoot for the moon—these are the hallmarks of modern goal science. ([Location 292](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078FZ9SYB&location=292))
- the four OKR “superpowers”: focus, align, track, and stretch. ([Location 298](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078FZ9SYB&location=298))
#### Superpower #1—Focus and Commit to Priorities (chapters 4, 5, and 6):
#### Superpower #2—Align and Connect for Teamwork (chapters 7, 8, and 9):
#### Superpower #3—Track for Accountability (chapters 10 and 11):
- all in a spirit of no-judgment accountability. ([Location 311](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078FZ9SYB&location=311))
- By testing our limits and affording the freedom to fail, they release our most creative, ambitious selves. ([Location 314](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078FZ9SYB&location=314))
#### CFRs (chapters 15 and 16):
- CFRs (Conversation, Feedback, Recognition), ([Location 319](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078FZ9SYB&location=319))
#### Continuous Improvement (chapter 17):

### 2 The Father of OKRs
- The objective is the direction: ([Location 374](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078FZ9SYB&location=374))
#### Our MBO Ancestors
- In 1954, in his landmark book The Practice of Management, Drucker codified this principle as “management by objectives and self-control.” It became Andy Grove’s foundation and the genesis of what we now call the OKR. ([Location 397](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078FZ9SYB&location=397))
- Eventually, though, the limitations of MBOs caught up with them. At many companies, goals were centrally planned and sluggishly trickled down the hierarchy. At others, they became stagnant for lack of frequent updating; or trapped and obscured in silos; or reduced to key performance indicators (KPIs), numbers without soul or context. Most deadly of all, MBOs were commonly tied to salaries and bonuses. ([Location 402](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078FZ9SYB&location=402))
#### Measuring Output
- He sought to “create an environment that values and emphasizes output” and to avoid what Drucker termed the “activity trap”: “[S]tressing output is the key to increasing productivity, while looking to increase activity can result in just the opposite.” ([Location 409](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078FZ9SYB&location=409))
##### MBOs vs. OKRs
- MBOs Intel OKRs “What” “What” and “How” Annual Quarterly or Monthly Private and Siloed Public and Transparent Top-down Bottom-up or Sideways (~50%) Tied to Compensation Mostly Divorced from Compensation Risk Averse Aggressive and Aspirational ([Location 423](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078FZ9SYB&location=423))
#### Intel’s Lifeblood
#### Andy Grove, OKR Incarnate
#### Andy Grove’s Legacy
- A limit of three to five OKRs per cycle leads companies, teams, and individuals to choose what matters most. In general, each objective should be tied to five or fewer key results. ([Location 514](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078FZ9SYB&location=514))
- teams and individuals should be encouraged to create roughly half of their own OKRs, in consultation with managers. ([Location 517](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078FZ9SYB&location=517))
- Even after company objectives are closed to debate, their key results continue to be negotiated. ([Location 520](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078FZ9SYB&location=520))
- aspirational OKRs should be uncomfortable and possibly unattainable. ([Location 526](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078FZ9SYB&location=526))
- To encourage risk taking and prevent sandbagging, OKRs and bonuses are best kept separate. ([Location 530](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078FZ9SYB&location=530))
- An organization may need up to four or five quarterly cycles to fully embrace the system, and even more than that to build mature goal muscle. ([Location 533](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078FZ9SYB&location=533))
### 3 Operation Crush: An Intel Story
- Bill grafted the critical connective tissue—the phrase “as measured by,” or a.m.b.—into Intel’s company OKRs. ... Bill’s a.m.b made the implicit explicit to all. ([Location 564](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078FZ9SYB&location=564))
- We were all taught that if you measured it, things got better. ([Location 579](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078FZ9SYB&location=579))
#### Intel’s Urgency
#### Turning on a Dime
#### The Greater Good
- “Bad companies,” Andy wrote, “are destroyed by crisis. Good companies survive them. Great companies are improved by them.” ([Location 671](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078FZ9SYB&location=671))
### 4 Superpower #1: Focus and Commit to Priorities
- An effective goal-setting system starts with disciplined thinking at the top, with leaders who invest the time and energy to choose what counts. ([Location 684](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078FZ9SYB&location=684))
#### In the Beginning . . .
- Regardless of how leaders choose a company’s top-line goals, they also need goals of their own. ([Location 703](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078FZ9SYB&location=703))
- When I hear CEOs say “All my goals are team goals,” it’s a red flag. ([Location 706](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078FZ9SYB&location=706))
#### Communicate with Clarity
- top-line goals must be clearly understood throughout the organization. Yet by their own admission, two of three companies fail to communicate these goals consistently. ([Location 711](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078FZ9SYB&location=711))
- Leaders must get across the why as well as the what. ([Location 714](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078FZ9SYB&location=714))
#### Key Results: Care and Feeding
- Objectives and key results are the yin and yang of goal setting—principle and practice, vision and execution. Objectives are the stuff of inspiration and far horizons. Key results are more earthbound and metric-driven. ([Location 718](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078FZ9SYB&location=718))
- They typically include hard numbers for one or more gauges: revenue, growth, active users, quality, safety, market share, customer engagement. ([Location 719](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078FZ9SYB&location=719))
- If an objective is well framed, three to five KRs will usually be adequate to reach it. ([Location 722](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078FZ9SYB&location=722))
- each key result should be a challenge in its own right. ([Location 723](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078FZ9SYB&location=723))
#### What, How, When
- The best practice may be a parallel, dual cadence, with short-horizon OKRs (for the here and now) supporting annual OKRs and longer-term strategies. ([Location 727](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078FZ9SYB&location=727))
- Clear-cut time frames intensify our focus and commitment; nothing moves us forward like a deadline. ([Location 729](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078FZ9SYB&location=729))
- In my experience, a quarterly OKR cadence is best suited to keep pace with today’s fast-changing markets. ([Location 730](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078FZ9SYB&location=730))
- For the feedback to be effective, it must be received very soon after the activity it is measuring occurs. ([Location 732](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078FZ9SYB&location=732))
#### Pairing Key Results
- Looking back, Ford didn’t lack for objectives or key results. But its goal-setting process was fatally flawed: “The specific, challenging goals were met (speed to market, fuel efficiency, and cost) at the expense of other important features that were not specified (safety, ethical behavior, and company reputation).” ([Location 749](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078FZ9SYB&location=749))
- The more ambitious the OKR, the greater the risk of overlooking a vital criterion. To safeguard quality while pushing for quantitative deliverables, one solution is to pair key results—to measure “both effect and counter-effect,” ([Location 756](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078FZ9SYB&location=756))
##### Table 4.1: Key Results Paired for Quantity and Quality
#### The Perfect and the Good
- A few goal-setting ground rules: Key results should be succinct, specific, and measurable. A mix of outputs and inputs is helpful. Finally, completion of all key results must result in attainment of the objective. ([Location 779](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078FZ9SYB&location=779))
##### Table 4.2: An OKR Quality Continuum
#### Less Is More
- In most cases, the ideal number of quarterly OKRs will range between three and five. ([Location 795](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078FZ9SYB&location=795))
- selective goal setting is the first line of defense against getting overextended. ([Location 800](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078FZ9SYB&location=800))
- Once contributors have consulted with their managers and committed to their OKRs for the quarter, any add-on objectives or key results must fit into the established agenda. ([Location 801](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078FZ9SYB&location=801))
- OKRs are neither a catchall wish list nor the sum of a team’s mundane tasks. They’re a set of stringently curated goals that merit special attention and will move people forward in the here and now. ([Location 810](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078FZ9SYB&location=810))
- “The art of management,” Grove wrote, “lies in the capacity to select from the many activities of seemingly comparable significance the one or two or three that provide leverage well beyond the others and concentrate on them.” ([Location 813](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078FZ9SYB&location=813))
### 5 Focus: The Remind Story
- Focus is essential for choosing the right goals—for ([Location 825](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078FZ9SYB&location=825))
- Each day she’d begin by asking, “What do you have to do today?” I’d run down my list: a history worksheet, an English essay, an upcoming math test. Then she’d say something really smart: “Okay, let’s just pick one and talk about it.” We focused on one thing at a time, and I’d get it done. “Just keep trying,” she encouraged me. “You’ll get it. I have all day.” The panicked beating in my chest subsided. School would never be easy for me, but I began to believe I could handle it. ([Location 841](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078FZ9SYB&location=841))
#### Twitter for Education
- We learned the three watchwords for entrepreneurs: Solve a problem Build a simple product Talk to your users ([Location 873](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078FZ9SYB&location=873))
#### Scaling on a Shoestring
- discern what was inessential, ([Location 903](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078FZ9SYB&location=903))
#### Goals for Growth
- In my view, you can only do one big thing at a time really well, and so you better know what that one thing is. ([Location 921](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078FZ9SYB&location=921))
- And they need to see it’s okay to make a mistake, to correct it and move on. You can’t fear screwing up. That squelches innovation. ([Location 941](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078FZ9SYB&location=941))
#### An OKR Legacy
### 6 Commit: The Nuna Story
- Alongside focus, commitment is a core element of our first superpower. In implementing OKRs, leaders must publicly commit to their objectives and stay steadfast. ([Location 962](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078FZ9SYB&location=962))
- You need to build your goal muscle gradually, incrementally. ([Location 998](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078FZ9SYB&location=998))
- For structured goal setting to prosper, as our company learned the hard way, executives need to commit to the process. It may take a quarter or two to overcome your managers’ resistance and get them acclimated to OKRs—to view them not as a necessary evil, or some perfunctory exercise, but as a practical tool to fulfill your organization’s top priorities. ([Location 1002](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078FZ9SYB&location=1002))
- The more challenging an objective, the more tempting it may be to abandon it. ([Location 1006](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078FZ9SYB&location=1006))
- But there are times when the system is more useful in a private mode. ([Location 1031](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078FZ9SYB&location=1031))
- “You’re not going to get the system just right the first time around. It’s not going to be perfect the second or third time, either. But don’t get discouraged. Persevere. You need to adapt it and make it your own.” ([Location 1041](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078FZ9SYB&location=1041))
- 7 Superpower #2: Align and Connect for Teamwork ([Location 1056](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078FZ9SYB&location=1056))
- Research shows that public goals are more likely to be attained than goals held in private. ([Location 1063](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078FZ9SYB&location=1063))
- In a recent survey of one thousand working U.S. adults, 92 percent said they’d be more motivated to reach their goals if colleagues could see their progress. ([Location 1065](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078FZ9SYB&location=1065))
- When people write down “This is what I’m working on,” it’s easier to see where the best ideas are coming from. ([Location 1068](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078FZ9SYB&location=1068))
- Soon it’s apparent that the individuals moving up are the ones doing what the company most values. ([Location 1069](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078FZ9SYB&location=1069))
- Transparency seeds collaboration. ([Location 1071](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078FZ9SYB&location=1071))
- By clearing a line of sight to everyone’s objectives, OKRs expose redundant efforts and save time and money. ([Location 1074](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078FZ9SYB&location=1074))
#### The Same Page
#### The Grand Cascade
#### The Sand Hill Unicorns:
##### Fantasy Football
- In moderation, cascading makes an operation more coherent. But when all objectives are cascaded, the process can degrade into a mechanical, color-by-numbers exercise, with four adverse effects: ... A loss of agility. ... A lack of flexibility. ... Marginalized contributors. ... One-dimensional linkages. ([Location 1125](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078FZ9SYB&location=1125))
- In a top-down ecosystem, contributors will hesitate to share goal-related concerns or promising ideas. ([Location 1134](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078FZ9SYB&location=1134))
#### Bottoms Up!
- To avoid compulsive, soul-killing overalignment, healthy organizations encourage some goals to emerge from the bottom up. ([Location 1150](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078FZ9SYB&location=1150))
- Innovation tends to dwell less at the center of an organization than at its edges. ([Location 1154](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078FZ9SYB&location=1154))
- A healthy OKR environment strikes a balance between alignment and autonomy, common purpose and creative latitude. ([Location 1158](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078FZ9SYB&location=1158))
- An optimal OKR system frees contributors to set at least some of their own objectives and most or all of their key results. ([Location 1163](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078FZ9SYB&location=1163))
- People who choose their destination will own a deeper awareness of what it takes to get there. ([Location 1165](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078FZ9SYB&location=1165))
- High-functioning teams thrive on a creative tension between top-down and bottom-up goal setting, a mix of aligned and unaligned OKRs. ([Location 1169](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078FZ9SYB&location=1169))
- In times of operational urgency, when simple doing takes precedence, organizations may choose to be more directive. But when the numbers are strong and a company has grown too cautious and buttoned-up, a lighter touch may be just right. When leaders are attuned to the fluctuating needs of both the business and their employees, the mix of top-down and bottom-up goals generally settles at around half-and-half. ([Location 1170](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078FZ9SYB&location=1170))
#### Cross-functional Coordination
- unacknowledged dependencies remain the number one cause of project slippage. The cure is lateral, cross-functional connectivity, peer-to-peer and team-to-team. ([Location 1175](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078FZ9SYB&location=1175))
### 8 Align: The MyFitnessPal Story
- OKRs are not islands. To the contrary, they create networks—vertical, horizontal, diagonal—to connect an organization’s most vital work. ([Location 1198](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078FZ9SYB&location=1198))
- We tackled one goal at a time and worked until it was done, and then we moved to the next item on the list. ([Location 1221](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078FZ9SYB&location=1221))
- I found that entropy begins when you have two great people directly under you. You want to give each of them something big and purposeful to work on, and they both naturally want to move their piece of the project, and soon they’re pulling out of alignment and charging in different directions. Before you know it, they’re working on two different things. It doesn’t help to push them harder. If two nails are even slightly misaligned, a good hammer will splay them sideways. ([Location 1230](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078FZ9SYB&location=1230))
#### Cross-team Integration
- Most contributors will be motivated to ladder up to the top-line OKRs—assuming they know where to set the ladder. ([Location 1249](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078FZ9SYB&location=1249))
- As I see it, co-ownership weakens accountability. ([Location 1271](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078FZ9SYB&location=1271))
#### Unacknowledged Dependencies, Writ Larger
- At scale, alignment grows exponentially more complex. ([Location 1286](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078FZ9SYB&location=1286))
#### North Star Alignment
- We publish our objectives on a wiki that anybody in the company can see. We discuss them at weekly all-hands meetings. ([Location 1318](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078FZ9SYB&location=1318))
### 9 Connect: The Intuit Story
- As they’ve built their goal-setting muscle with real-time, automated data and routine check-ins, users align roughly half of their OKRs with the goals of higher-ups or their department. ([Location 1359](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078FZ9SYB&location=1359))
- In the storm of any disruption, IT will bear the brunt of in-house frustrations. Partly it’s because the operation tends to be opaque. ([Location 1372](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078FZ9SYB&location=1372))
- Once each month, managers meet with their reports to discuss individual goals. The system has built-in, 360-degree feedback, with both parties comparing notes on a regular basis. ([Location 1382](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078FZ9SYB&location=1382))
- Today, every employee in my department owns three to five business objectives per quarter, along with one or two personal ones. ([Location 1390](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078FZ9SYB&location=1390))
- When people understand your priorities and constraints, they’re more apt to trust you when something goes sideways. ([Location 1393](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078FZ9SYB&location=1393))
#### Live Data from the Cloud
#### A Tool for Global Collaboration
#### Horizontal Connections
- OKRs have opened our department horizontally, across teams. ([Location 1468](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078FZ9SYB&location=1468))
### 10 Superpower #3: Track for Accountability
- Unlike traditional, frozen, “set them and forget them” business goals, OKRs are living, breathing organisms. Their life cycle unfolds in three phases, ([Location 1483](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078FZ9SYB&location=1483))
#### The Setup
#### OKR Shepherd
- This is not administrative busywork, it’s an important way to set your priorities for the quarter and ensure that we’re all working together. ([Location 1530](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078FZ9SYB&location=1530))
#### Midlife Tracking
- Research suggests that making measured headway can be more incentivizing than public recognition, monetary inducements, or even achieving the goal itself. ([Location 1534](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078FZ9SYB&location=1534))
- people crave to know how they’re progressing and see it visually represented, down to the percentage point. ([Location 1534](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078FZ9SYB&location=1534))
- Unlike steps on Fitbit, OKRs don’t require daily tracking. But regular check-ins—preferably weekly—are essential to prevent slippage. ([Location 1538](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078FZ9SYB&location=1538))
- As we track and audit our OKRs, we have four options at any point in the cycle: ...
  * Continue: If a green zone (“on track”) goal isn’t broken, don’t fix it. ...
  * Update: Modify a yellow zone (“needs attention”) key result or objective to respond to changes in the workflow or external environment. ...
  * Start: Launch a new OKR mid-cycle, whenever the need arises. ...
  * Stop: When a red zone (“at risk”) goal has outlived its usefulness, the best solution may be to drop it. ([Location 1545](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078FZ9SYB&location=1545))
- The point of a real-time dashboard is to quantify progress against a target and flag what needs attention. While OKRs are primarily a positive force for more, they also stop us from persisting in the wrong direction. ([Location 1553](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078FZ9SYB&location=1553))
- Late-in-game surprises are less likely when you track your OKRs for continuous feedback. ([Location 1555](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078FZ9SYB&location=1555))
- Our goals are servants to our purpose, not the other way around. ([Location 1562](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078FZ9SYB&location=1562))
- One proviso: When an objective gets dropped before the end of the OKR interval, it’s important to notify everyone depending on it. Then comes reflection: What did I learn that I didn’t foresee at the beginning of the quarter? And: How will I apply this lesson in the future? ([Location 1563](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078FZ9SYB&location=1563))
- For best results, OKRs are scrutinized several times per quarter by contributors and their managers. ([Location 1565](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078FZ9SYB&location=1565))
- The more dispersed the team’s members, the more frequently they touch base. ([Location 1569](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078FZ9SYB&location=1569))
#### Wrap-up: Rinse and Repeat
- OKRs do not expire with completion of the work. As in any data-driven system, tremendous value can be gained from post hoc evaluation and analysis. ([Location 1572](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078FZ9SYB&location=1572))
##### Scoring
- In scoring our OKRs, we mark what we’ve achieved and address how we might do it differently next time. ([Location 1575](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078FZ9SYB&location=1575))
- On state-of-the-art goal management platforms, OKR scores are system-generated; the numbers are objective, untouched by human hands. ([Location 1576](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078FZ9SYB&location=1576))
##### Self-assessment
- In the end, the numbers are probably less important than contextual feedback and a broader discussion within the team. ([Location 1634](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078FZ9SYB&location=1634))
##### Reflection
- the key to satisfaction is to set aggressive goals, achieve most of them, pause to reflect on the achievement, and then repeat the cycle. ([Location 1638](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078FZ9SYB&location=1638))
- Here are some reflections for closing out an OKR cycle: Did I accomplish all of my objectives? If so, what contributed to my success? If not, what obstacles did I encounter? If I were to rewrite a goal achieved in full, what would I change? What have I learned that might alter my approach to the next cycle’s OKRs? ([Location 1642](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078FZ9SYB&location=1642))

- Aspirational goals draw on every OKR superpower. Focus and commitment are a must for targeting goals that make a real difference. Only a transparent, collaborative, aligned, and connected organization can achieve so far beyond the norm. And without quantifiable tracking, how can you know when you’ve reached that amazing stretch objective? ([Location 1762](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078FZ9SYB&location=1762))
#### Our Need to Stretch

### 15 Continuous Performance Management: OKRs and CFRs
- That transformational system, the contemporary alternative to annual reviews, is continuous performance management. It is implemented with an instrument called CFRs, for: Conversations: an authentic, richly textured exchange between manager and contributor, aimed at driving performance Feedback: bidirectional or networked communication among peers to evaluate progress and guide future improvement Recognition: expressions of appreciation to deserving individuals for contributions of all sizes ([Location 2222](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078FZ9SYB&location=2222))
- You need continuous performance management to surface the critical questions: Was the goal harder to achieve than you’d thought when you set it? Was it the right goal in the first place? Is it motivating? Should we double down on the two or three things that really worked for us last quarter, or is it time to consider a pivot? ([Location 2233](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078FZ9SYB&location=2233))
#### Reinventing HR

- It centers on five questions: What are you working on? How are you doing; how are your OKRs coming along? Is there anything impeding your work? What do you need from me to be (more) successful? How do you need to grow to achieve your career goals? ([Location 2286](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078FZ9SYB&location=2286))

#### Feedback
#### Recognition
- Replace “Employee of the Month” with “Achievement of the Month.” ([Location 2370](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078FZ9SYB&location=2370))
- Make recognition frequent and attainable. ([Location 2373](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078FZ9SYB&location=2373))
### Ditching Annual Performance Reviews: The Adobe Story
- Managers are trained to scale compensation based on employees’ performance, their impact on the business, the relative scarcity of their skills, and market conditions. ([Location 2406](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078FZ9SYB&location=2406))
- Our leaders role-modeled Check-in. They needed to show they were open to feedback themselves, and comfortable being questioned on their vision. ([Location 2419](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078FZ9SYB&location=2419))

#### Adobe Performance Management, Then and Now
### 17 Baking Better Every Day: The Zume Pizza Story
#### Achieving What’s Real
- What’s neat about OKRs is that they formalize reflection. At least once each quarter, they make contributors step back into a quiet place and consider how their decisions align with the company. People start thinking in the macro. They become more pointed and precise, because you can’t write a ninety-page OKR dissertation. You have to choose three to five things and exactly how they should be measured. Then when the day comes and someone says, “Okay, you’re a manager,” you’ve already learned how to think like one. And that’s huge. ([Location 2544](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078FZ9SYB&location=2544))
- The better way is to train people to think like leaders from the start, when their departments have a staff of one. ([Location 2552](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078FZ9SYB&location=2552))

#### Better Culture
### 18 Culture
- By aligning teams to work toward a handful of common objectives, then uniting them through lightweight, goal-oriented communications, OKRs and CFRs create transparency and accountability, the tent poles for sustained high performance. ([Location 2681](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078FZ9SYB&location=2681))
- In Project Aristotle, an internal Google study of 180 teams, standout performance correlated to affirmative responses to these five questions: *Structure and clarity*: Are goals, roles, and execution plans on our team clear?
  *Psychological safety*: Can we take risks on this team without feeling insecure or embarrassed?
  *Meaning of work*: Are we working on something that is personally important for each of us?
  *Dependability*: Can we count on each other to do high-quality work on time?
  *Impact of work*: Do we fundamentally believe that the work we’re doing matters? ([Location 2698](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078FZ9SYB&location=2698))

- culture is about the people you recruit and the values they bring to bear. ([Location 2848](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078FZ9SYB&location=2848))
#### OKR Resurrection
- Transparency is scary. Admitting your failures—visibly, publicly—can be terrifying. We had to rewire people from how they’d been raised since kindergarten. ([Location 2869](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078FZ9SYB&location=2869))
- Once you start having honest, vulnerable, two-way conversations with your direct reports, you begin to see what makes them tick. You feel their yearning to connect to things bigger than themselves. You hear their need for recognition that what they’re doing matters. Through the open window of objectives and key results, each of you gets to know the other’s weaknesses with no worry of getting caught out. (For managers, one particular benefit of OKRs is to lead them to hires who can compensate for their own limitations.) Our people stopped dancing around their setbacks. They began to realize there was no shame in trying your hardest and failing, not when OKRs help you fail smart and fail fast.

### DEDICATION
### RESOURCE 1 Google’s OKR Playbook
- make conscious, careful, and informed choices about how we allocate our time and energy—as individuals and as members of teams. OKRs are the manifestation of those careful choices, and the means by which we coordinate the actions of individuals to achieve great collective goals. ([Location 3186](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078FZ9SYB&location=3186))
- 0.0–0.3 is red 0.4–0.6 is yellow 0.7–1.0 is green ([Location 3192](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078FZ9SYB&location=3192))
#### Writing Effective OKRs
- Objectives are the “Whats.” They: express goals and intents; are aggressive yet realistic; must be tangible, objective, and unambiguous; should be obvious to a rational observer whether an objective has been achieved. The successful achievement of an objective must provide clear value for Google. ([Location 3197](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078FZ9SYB&location=3197))
- Key Results are the “Hows.” They: express measurable milestones which, if achieved, will advance objective(s) in a useful manner to their constituents; must describe outcomes, not activities. If your KRs include words like “consult,” “help,” “analyze,” or “participate,” they describe activities. Instead, describe the end-user impact of these activities: “publish average and tail latency measurements from six Colossus cells by March 7,” rather than “assess Colossus latency”; must include evidence of completion. This evidence must be available, credible, and easily discoverable. Examples of evidence include change lists, links to docs, notes, and published metrics reports. ([Location 3202](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078FZ9SYB&location=3202))
#### Cross-team OKRs
- Cross-team OKRs should include all the groups who must materially participate in the OKR, and OKRs committing to each group’s contribution should appear explicitly in each such group’s OKRs. ([Location 3211](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078FZ9SYB&location=3211))
#### Committed vs. Aspirational OKRs
- Commitments are OKRs that we agree will be achieved, and we will be willing to adjust schedules and resources to ensure that they are delivered. The expected score for a committed OKR is 1.0; a score of less than 1.0 requires explanation for the miss, as it shows errors in planning and/or execution. ([Location 3215](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078FZ9SYB&location=3215))
- aspirational OKRs express how we’d like the world to look, even though we have no clear idea how to get there and/or the resources necessary to deliver the OKR. Aspirational OKRs have an expected average score of 0.7, with high variance. ([Location 3218](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078FZ9SYB&location=3218))
#### Classic OKR-Writing Mistakes and Traps
##### TRAP #1: Failing to differentiate between committed and aspirational OKRs.
##### TRAP #2: Business-as-usual OKRs.
##### TRAP #3: Timid aspirational OKRs.
- “What could my [or my customers’] world look like in several years if we were freed from most constraints?” ([Location 3232](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078FZ9SYB&location=3232))
##### TRAP #4: Sandbagging.
- Teams who can meet all of their OKRs without needing all of their team’s headcount/capital . . . are assumed to either be hoarding resources or not pushing their teams, or both. This is a cue for senior management to reassign headcount and other resources to groups who will make more effective use of them. ([Location 3239](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078FZ9SYB&location=3239))
##### TRAP #5: Low Value Objectives (aka the “Who cares?” OKR). OKRs must promise clear business value—otherwise, there’s no reason to expend resources doing them. Low Value Objectives (LVOs) are those for which, even if the Objective is completed with a 1.0, no one will notice or care.
- Could the OKR get a 1.0 under reasonable circumstances without providing direct end-user or economic benefit? If so, then reword the OKR to focus on the tangible benefit. ([Location 3248](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078FZ9SYB&location=3248))
##### TRAP #6: Insufficient KRs for committed Os.
- It is critical that KRs are written such that scoring 1.0 on all key results generates a 1.0 score for the objective. ([Location 3253](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078FZ9SYB&location=3253))
- A common error is writing key results that are necessary but not sufficient to collectively complete the objective. ([Location 3255](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078FZ9SYB&location=3255))
#### Reading, Interpreting, and Acting on OKRs
- A committed OKR that fails to achieve a 1.0 by its due date requires a postmortem. ([Location 3271](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078FZ9SYB&location=3271))
- Aspirational OKRs and their associated priorities should remain on a team’s OKR list until they are completed, carrying them forward from quarter to quarter as necessary. ([Location 3279](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078FZ9SYB&location=3279))
- It is good to move an aspirational OKR to a different team’s list if that team has both the expertise and bandwidth to accomplish the OKR more effectively than the current OKR owner. ([Location 3282](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078FZ9SYB&location=3282))

- Which of these OKRs aligns to key initiatives in the organization? ([Location 3332](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078FZ9SYB&location=3332))
#### Progress Updates
- To get the contributor talking, a manager might pose these questions: How are your OKRs coming along? What critical capabilities do you need to be successful? Is there anything stopping you from attaining your objectives? What OKRs need to be adjusted—or added, or eliminated—in light of shifting priorities? ([Location 3334](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078FZ9SYB&location=3334))
#### Manager-led Coaching
- To prepare for this conversation, the manager should consider the following questions:
  What behaviors or values do I want my report to continue to exhibit?
  What behaviors or values do I want the report to start or stop exhibiting?
  What coaching can I provide to help the report fully realize his or her potential?
  During the conversation, the leader might ask:
  What part of your job most excites you?
  What (if any) aspect of your role would you like to change? ([Location 3340](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078FZ9SYB&location=3340))
    - Tags: [[inbox]] [[coaching]] 
#### Upward Feedback
- To elicit candid input from a contributor, the manager might ask: What are you getting from me that you find helpful? What are you getting from me that impedes your ability to be effective? What could I do for you that would help you to be more successful? ([Location 3347](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078FZ9SYB&location=3347))
- To tease out a contributor’s career aspirations, a manager might ask:
  What skills or capabilities would you like to develop to improve in your current role?
  In what areas do you want to grow to achieve your career goals?
  What skills or capabilities would you like to develop for a future role?
  From a learning, growth, and development standpoint, how can I and the company help you get there? ([Location 3352](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078FZ9SYB&location=3352))
#### Career Growth
#### Prepping for Performance Conversations
- Before launching a performance conversation with a contributor, some prep work is in order. Specifically, leaders should consider the following: What were the contributor’s main objectives and responsibilities in the period in question? How has the contributor performed? If the contributor is underperforming, how should he or she course-correct? If the contributor is performing well or exceeding expectations, what can I do to sustain a high level of performance without burnout? When is the contributor most engaged? When is the contributor least engaged? What strengths does the contributor bring to the work? What types of learning experience might benefit this contributor? Over the next six months, what should the contributor’s focus be? Meeting expectations in his or her current role? Maximizing contributions in the current role? Or preparing for the next opportunity—be it a new project, expanded responsibility, or new role? ([Location 3358](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078FZ9SYB&location=3358))
    - Note: Added to roam: One on One
- Contributors, too, should prepare for performance conversations. Specifically, they can ask themselves: Am I on track to meet my objectives? Have I identified areas of opportunity? Do I understand how my work connects to broader milestones? What feedback can I give my manager? ([Location 3370](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078FZ9SYB&location=3370))
### RESOURCE 4 In Sum
#### Focus and Commit to Priorities
- I recommend dual tracking, with quarterly OKRs (for shorter-term goals) and annual OKRs (keyed to longer-term strategies) deployed in parallel. ([Location 3382](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078FZ9SYB&location=3382))
- For each objective, settle on no more than five measurable, unambiguous, time-bound key results—how the objective will be attained. By definition, completion of all key results equates to the attainment of the objective. ([Location 3391](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078FZ9SYB&location=3391))
- For balance and quality control, pair qualitative and quantitative key results. ([Location 3393](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078FZ9SYB&location=3393))
#### Align and Connect for Teamwork
- Use all-hands meetings to explain why an OKR is important to the organization. Then keep repeating the message until you’re tired of hearing it yourself. ([Location 3399](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078FZ9SYB&location=3399))
- When deploying cascaded OKRs, with objectives driven from the top, welcome give-and-take on key results from frontline contributors. ([Location 3400](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078FZ9SYB&location=3400))
- Encourage a healthy proportion of bottom-up OKRs—roughly half. ([Location 3402](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078FZ9SYB&location=3402))
- When an OKR is revised or dropped, see to it that all stakeholders know about it. ([Location 3405](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078FZ9SYB&location=3405))
#### Track for Accountability
