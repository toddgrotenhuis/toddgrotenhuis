## Highlights
### CHAPTER 1: Introduction to the Cosmos
- In this book, I describe how small tweaks to our current, incomplete knowledge of the cosmos can result in vastly different paths into the future, from a universe that collapses on itself, to one that rips itself apart, to one that succumbs by degrees to an inescapable expanding bubble of doom. ([Location 85](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07Z41TTNK&location=85))
- It is said that astronauts returning from space carry with them a changed perspective on the world, the “overview effect,” in which, having seen the Earth from above, they can fully perceive how fragile our little oasis is and how unified we ought to be as a species, as perhaps the only thinking beings in the cosmos. For me, thinking about the ultimate destruction of the universe is just such an experience. ([Location 108](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07Z41TTNK&location=108))

- Acknowledging an ultimate end gives us context, meaning, even hope, and allows us, paradoxically, to step back from our petty day-to-day concerns and simultaneously live more fully in the moment. ([Location 113](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07Z41TTNK&location=113))
- As a general scientific term, cosmology refers to the study of the universe as a whole, from beginning to end, including its components, its evolution over time, and the fundamental physics governing it. ([Location 147](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07Z41TTNK&location=147))

- In astrophysics, a cosmologist is anyone who studies really distant things, because (1) that means looking at quite a lot of universe and (2) in astronomy, faraway things are also far in the past, since the light that reaches us from them has been traveling for a long time—sometimes billions of years. ([Location 148](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07Z41TTNK&location=148))

- In physics, cosmology can veer in a direction that is much more theoretical. ([Location 151](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07Z41TTNK&location=151))

- The upshot of all this is that cosmology means a lot of different things to a lot of different people. A cosmologist who studies the evolution of galaxies might be utterly lost talking with a cosmologist who studies the way quantum field theory can make black holes evaporate, and vice versa. ([Location 158](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07Z41TTNK&location=158))
- I work mainly in an area physicists call phenomenology—the space between the development of new theories and the part where they’re actually tested. That is to say, I find creative new ways to connect the things the fundamental-theory people hypothesize about the structure of the universe with what the observational astronomers and experimental physicists hope to see in their data.

### CHAPTER 2: Big Bang to Now
- We technically can’t see our own past at all. The light speed delay means that the more distant a thing is, the farther in the past it is, and that relationship is strict: not only can we not see our own past, we can’t see those distant galaxies in the present, either. The more distant something is, the farther away it is on a timeline of the cosmos. ([Location 250](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07Z41TTNK&location=250))
- cosmological principle. Simply stated, it’s the idea that for all practical purposes, the universe is basically the same everywhere. Obviously this isn’t true on human scales—the surface of the Earth is pretty importantly different from deep space or the center of the Sun—but on the kind of astronomically large scales on which whole galaxies can be tallied up as individually uninteresting specks, the universe looks the same in every direction, and is made of all the same stuff.I ([Location 257](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07Z41TTNK&location=257))

- Copernican Principle, which is the erstwhile heretical notion stated by Nicolaus Copernicus in the sixteenth century that we do not occupy a “special place” in the cosmos, but are just at some generic spot that may as well have been chosen at random. ([Location 261](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07Z41TTNK&location=261))

- The Big Bang wasn’t an explosion within the universe, it was an expansion of the universe. And it didn’t happen at a single point, but at every point. Every point in space in the universe today—a spot on the edge of a distant galaxy, a piece of intergalactic space just as far in the other direction, the room in which you were born—every one of these points was, at the beginning of time, close enough to touch, and at that same first moment, rapidly tearing away from one another. ([Location 299](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07Z41TTNK&location=299))
- In fact, based on what we know, it’s entirely possible, and perhaps probable, that the universe is infinite in size. Which means that it was infinite at the beginning too. Just much denser. ([Location 307](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07Z41TTNK&location=307))
- Aside from lasers, anything that produces light makes it at a spread of different frequencies (or colors), and the color it appears to the eye is just the color where the light is most intense. ([Location 383](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07Z41TTNK&location=383))
- For any thermal radiation, including that emitted by pokers and people and the little blue flames on gas stovetops, the intensity of the light changes with frequency in exactly the same way. The light is brightest at some peak color depending on the temperature, and it dims quickly for colors on either side. Plotting out on a graph how the intensity rises and falls with frequency gives you a shape we call the blackbody curve—a curve reproduced by anything that glows because it is hot.XI ([Location 385](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07Z41TTNK&location=385))

- it turns out that if you measure the intensity of the cosmic microwave background at different frequencies, you get the most precise, most perfect blackbody curve ever measured in nature. The only way to explain this is that the universe itself was once, everywhere, extremely hot. ([Location 389](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07Z41TTNK&location=389))
- Gravitational collapse is a powerful thing. If you have a little bit of matter that’s denser than the matter around it, it will pull in more from those less dense places, which increases the contrast, which pulls in more, and so on. ([Location 411](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07Z41TTNK&location=411))
- Any time you have a lot of energy in a very small space, you have to deal with both quantum mechanics (the theory governing particle physics) and general relativity (the theory of gravity) at the same time. Under normal circumstances, you’re only dealing with one or the other, because when gravity is important, it’s usually because you have a massive thing, so you can ignore the individual particles, and when quantum mechanics is important, at the particle scale, you’re dealing with so little mass that gravity is a totally negligible part of the interaction. But at extreme densities you have to contend with both, and they don’t work well together, at all. ([Location 451](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07Z41TTNK&location=451))
- Without a full theory of quantum gravity (something that reconciles particle physics with gravity), there’s a limit to how far back we can extrapolate the universe in a way that makes sense. ([Location 460](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07Z41TTNK&location=460))
- The theory of inflation came about to solve a few really perplexing problems in the standard Big Bang model. One has to do with the weird uniformity of the cosmic microwave background, another with its tiny imperfections. ([Location 523](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07Z41TTNK&location=523))
    - Tags: [[definition]] 
- The uniformity problem is that the standard Big Bang cosmology doesn’t offer any explanation for how the whole observable universe, including parts on totally opposite sides of the sky, ended up being the same temperature at early times. ([Location 524](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07Z41TTNK&location=524))

- Normally, two things can become the same temperature if they’re in what we call thermodynamic equilibrium. This just means there’s a way for them to exchange heat, and time for them to do so. ([Location 527](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07Z41TTNK&location=527))
