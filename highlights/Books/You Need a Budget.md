## Highlights
- when we’re stressed about our finances, it’s because we’re not sure our money decisions are aligned with the life we want to be living. ([Location 209](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071Y2XSFN&location=209))
- What do I want my money to do for me? ([Location 213](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071Y2XSFN&location=213))
- What do I want? and What do I want my money to do for me? are different questions. ([Location 221](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071Y2XSFN&location=221))
- Forget about the things you can’t do with your money (I can’t afford that trip), or the things you have to do with your money (I have to pay off my student loans). Instead, think of what you want, and go from there. ([Location 235](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071Y2XSFN&location=235))
- That’s the beauty of a (good) budget: it lets you see exactly how your spending affects the rest of your life. ([Location 242](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071Y2XSFN&location=242))
- There’s nothing like the joy of zapping meaningless expenses and putting those dollars toward something that once seemed like a pipe dream. ([Location 247](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071Y2XSFN&location=247))
- Because your money is going toward your highest priorities, your spending has to clear a higher bar. ([Location 263](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071Y2XSFN&location=263))
- No need for stress. Just pull some money from lower-priority categories and carry on. ([Location 269](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071Y2XSFN&location=269))
- When you increase the time that passes between receiving your money and spending it, you’re more secure, more flexible. ([Location 272](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071Y2XSFN&location=272))
- It’s fun to forecast and dream of the life you want if you can someday get those numbers to work. But how about looking at the money you have right now and creating a spending plan based on what’s most important to you? That’s what YNAB is all about. ([Location 374](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071Y2XSFN&location=374))
- Just make sure you don’t forecast future money. That cash will be great when it hits your account, but you’re only concerned with making sure the money you have today gets you closer to your goals. ([Location 380](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071Y2XSFN&location=380))
- The moment you let your priorities lead, you’ll find that many of your anxieties around money—and the jitters you thought weren’t about money at all—quickly disappear. ([Location 382](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071Y2XSFN&location=382))
- Scarcity is simply that feeling of wishing there were more. ([Location 410](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071Y2XSFN&location=410))
- Scarcity pushes us to be very concrete about our priorities, and those that matter to us the most make themselves known in these moments. ([Location 412](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071Y2XSFN&location=412))
- If guilt haunts you it’s usually because: 1.    You know in your gut that a bigger priority needs more of your attention; or 2.    You’re letting other people’s expectations of how you should live your life color your choices. ([Location 503](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071Y2XSFN&location=503))
- fund your obligations before you do anything else. ([Location 588](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071Y2XSFN&location=588))
- Just make sure you’ve set aside enough to keep food in your fridge, a roof over your head, and the collection agencies off your porch. ([Location 589](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071Y2XSFN&location=589))
- make sure you’re separating honest-to-goodness obligations from habits disguised as necessities. ([Location 598](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071Y2XSFN&location=598))
- habits are ultimately negotiable in a pinch—your obligations are not. ([Location 599](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071Y2XSFN&location=599))
- Take the time to think about what makes you happy and add those things to your budget—even if they’re just ambitious notes right now, ([Location 679](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071Y2XSFN&location=679))
- Lifestyle creep is when the cost of your lifestyle rises in tandem with your income. ([Location 820](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071Y2XSFN&location=820))
- Once a year (I like to do this in January), question every one of your expenses. ([Location 828](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071Y2XSFN&location=828))
- The idea is to start with just your bank account balance, then slowly add in your expenses one at a time. ([Location 845](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071Y2XSFN&location=845))
- Take care of your immediate obligations first ([Location 857](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071Y2XSFN&location=857))
- What are your highest priorities after your obligations? ([Location 863](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071Y2XSFN&location=863))
- From there, we get into things that require money, but are just for fun. ([Location 865](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071Y2XSFN&location=865))
- Rule Two is all about thinking long, and acting now. ([Location 875](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071Y2XSFN&location=875))
- your true expenses are ALL of your expenses—the daily, the monthly, and the irregular ones that we often forget. ([Location 880](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071Y2XSFN&location=880))
- Your unpredictable but inevitable expenses, on the other hand, are the things you know you’ll need to spend money on at some point—you just don’t know when or exactly how much. ([Location 899](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071Y2XSFN&location=899))
- your emotions are often a good measure of what you should tackle first, ([Location 961](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071Y2XSFN&location=961))
- If you’re feeling consumed by a goal, attack it as fiercely as it’s attacking you... ([Location 963](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071Y2XSFN&location=963))
- When your long-term goals are on your radar, your bank account balance is no longer the deciding factor in whether or not to buy something. ([Location 976](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071Y2XSFN&location=976))
- Now the trade-off isn’t about having less money, it’s about not having something you’ve decided you want. ([Location 987](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071Y2XSFN&location=987))
- Every time you choose to put money toward a long-term priority, you’re literally sending money ahead to the future, setting Future You up for success. ([Location 991](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071Y2XSFN&location=991))
- But the money you set aside for Rule Two is your emergency fund. Only better, it’s more targeted, more proactive, and likely to have you better prepared than that vague bubble of money sitting in the bank without a specific purpose. ([Location 1015](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071Y2XSFN&location=1015))
- Don’t get me wrong—there will always be a place for the “I lost my job” emergency fund. ([Location 1018](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071Y2XSFN&location=1018))
- if you’re just worried about income loss and have saved money to cover that, call it what it is. ([Location 1023](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071Y2XSFN&location=1023))
- We can easily rationalize plucking money from a generic emergency fund when we’re not sure exactly what it’s being held for. But when you know that money is for medical bills, you’re much less likely to siphon from it to pay for a birthday present. ([Location 1031](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071Y2XSFN&location=1031))
- The stakes are clear. ([Location 1033](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071Y2XSFN&location=1033))
- think long and act now ([Location 1082](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071Y2XSFN&location=1082))
- Predictable expenses aren’t frequent but we know exactly when they’ll hit and how much they’ll cost. ([Location 1102](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071Y2XSFN&location=1102))
- This is exactly how we should treat our budget: like a flexible plan. ([Location 1136](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071Y2XSFN&location=1136))
- They feel that if they change it, they’re not really budgeting, they’re cheating—but that couldn’t be more wrong. ([Location 1137](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071Y2XSFN&location=1137))
- Rule Three is what will save you when all other budgeting apps, experts, and programs make you feel that you’ve failed the moment you stray from the original plan. ([Location 1144](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071Y2XSFN&location=1144))
- Accountability is dealing with the truth of every decision you make. You’re actually never more accountable than when you change your budget. ([Location 1151](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071Y2XSFN&location=1151))
- If you’ve overspent on eating out and need to take that money from a different priority, like vacation, that’s accountability. You are living the reality of what it means to spend more than you’d planned: you’re now that much farther from your vacation goal. It’s not a failure, but a reprioritization. ([Location 1153](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071Y2XSFN&location=1153))
- The goals are what matter. As long as you keep moving toward them, you’re succeeding. ([Location 1164](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071Y2XSFN&location=1164))
- It’s normal for anyone dedicated to achieving a big goal to adjust their plan as they go. ([Location 1165](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071Y2XSFN&location=1165))

- If you’re constantly adjusting to compensate for overspending in one area, you’re probably not being honest with yourself when you budget that number in the first place. ([Location 1181](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071Y2XSFN&location=1181))
- Your values will also help you decide how much you’re willing to bend when the punches land. ([Location 1224](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071Y2XSFN&location=1224))
- the longer you budget, the less the punches will hurt when they do land. ([Location 1249](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071Y2XSFN&location=1249))
- Changing my budget is not failing. ([Location 1303](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071Y2XSFN&location=1303))
- What is important is that you have enough on hand so you won’t be in trouble if your next paycheck doesn’t arrive. ([Location 1323](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071Y2XSFN&location=1323))

- a budget gives you both a structure for designing your life together, and to talk about your hopes and goals within a concrete framework. ([Location 1563](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071Y2XSFN&location=1563))
- You’re no longer just dreaming together—you’re working out a realistic action plan. ([Location 1565](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071Y2XSFN&location=1565))
- Nobody will be micromanaged or put on a leash. The point is to actually feel free and empowered. ([Location 1580](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071Y2XSFN&location=1580))
- As you get into the swing of budgeting you’ll have monthly number-crunching meetings ([Location 1656](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071Y2XSFN&location=1656))
- what’s most important to you as an individual, what’s important to your partner, and what you value together as a couple. ([Location 1660](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071Y2XSFN&location=1660))
- I recommend boiling your priorities down to a small number of things—around one for each of you, and two that you share. ([Location 1683](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071Y2XSFN&location=1683))
- You probably have more priorities than this but make an effort to zero in on your one selfish, personal priority. Then give each other more leeway to spend on that one thing. ([Location 1684](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071Y2XSFN&location=1684))
- it doesn’t have to be a painful session of who-spent-what and what-were-you-thinking. That is the last thing it should be. ([Location 1753](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071Y2XSFN&location=1753))
- it’s actually important to budget for the things that bring you joy. ([Location 1805](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071Y2XSFN&location=1805))
- Set yours, mine, and ours priorities, plus some no-questions-asked fun money for each of you. ([Location 1827](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071Y2XSFN&location=1827))
- Borrowing for a new car is always a bad idea, since its value decreases the second you drive it off the lot. ([Location 1860](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071Y2XSFN&location=1860))
- The government and private lenders have spent millions trying to make us believe that student loans are inevitable. They succeeded. It’s horrible. ([Location 1875](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071Y2XSFN&location=1875))
- The fewer things you’re juggling—whether they’re bank accounts or debt payments—the more clarity you have to focus on what’s most important to you. ([Location 1912](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071Y2XSFN&location=1912))
- The more you accomplish, the more you want to accomplish. ([Location 1975](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071Y2XSFN&location=1975))

- I’ve found that when most of us want to quit, it’s because we’re caught up in self-sabotaging behaviors that are actually pretty simple to fix. ([Location 2377](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071Y2XSFN&location=2377))
- We tend to fall into the trap of seeing our budget as black or white: failure or success. That’s simply not true. As long as you’re budgeting, you’re succeeding. ([Location 2385](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071Y2XSFN&location=2385))
- meaningful change takes time. Be kind to yourself (and to your partner). Set realistic goals and work your way toward them slowly. ([Location 2407](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071Y2XSFN&location=2407))
- You’re overdoing it when you obsess over your budget, check it several times a day, and talk about it to anyone who will give you an ear. ([Location 2415](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071Y2XSFN&location=2415))
- Treat your budget or your healthy habits like a fad and they’ll disappear like one. Work on integrating them into your real life and they will become your actual lifestyle. ([Location 2416](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071Y2XSFN&location=2416))
- A subset of budgeting OCD is trying to be too granular. ([Location 2423](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071Y2XSFN&location=2423))
- Unless one transaction very clearly straddles two spending targets (like when one Costco receipt covers food and skis and pajama pants), send it to one category and be at peace. ([Location 2426](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071Y2XSFN&location=2426))
