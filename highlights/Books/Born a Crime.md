## Highlights
- You separate people into groups and make them hate one another so you can run them all. ([Location 74](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01DHWACVY&location=74))
- these groups were given differing levels of rights and privileges in order to keep them at odds. ([Location 78](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01DHWACVY&location=78))
- The triumph of democracy over apartheid is sometimes called the Bloodless Revolution. It is called that because very little white blood was spilled. Black blood ran in the streets. ([Location 201](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01DHWACVY&location=201))
- When the British took over the Cape Colony, the descendants of the original Dutch settlers trekked inland and developed their own language, culture, and customs, eventually becoming their own people, the Afrikaners—the white tribe of Africa. ([Location 302](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01DHWACVY&location=302))
- The British abolished slavery in name but kept it in practice. They did so because, in the mid-1800s, in what had been written off as a near-worthless way station on the route to the Far East, a few lucky capitalists stumbled upon the richest gold and diamond reserves in the world, and an endless supply of expendable bodies was needed to go in the ground and get it all out. ([Location 304](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01DHWACVY&location=304))
- In America you had the forced removal of the native onto reservations coupled with slavery followed by segregation. Imagine all three of those things happening to the same group of people at the same time. That was apartheid. ([Location 313](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01DHWACVY&location=313))
- In any society built on institutionalized racism, race-mixing doesn’t merely challenge the system as unjust, it reveals the system as unsustainable and incoherent. Race-mixing proves that races can mix—and in a lot of cases, want to mix. Because a mixed person embodies that rebuke to the logic of the system, race-mixing becomes a crime worse than treason. ([Location 323](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01DHWACVY&location=323))
- There were whole police squads whose only job was to go around peeking through windows—clearly an assignment for only the finest law enforcement officers. ([Location 334](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01DHWACVY&location=334))
- But this so-called white country could not function without black labor to produce its wealth, which meant black people had to be allowed to live near white areas in the townships, government-planned ghettos built to house black workers, like Soweto. ([Location 357](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01DHWACVY&location=357))
- That’s how a police state works—everyone thinks everyone else is the police. ([Location 387](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01DHWACVY&location=387))
- Soweto was designed to be bombed—that’s how forward-thinking the architects of apartheid were. The township was a city unto itself, with a population of nearly one million. There were only two roads in and out. That was so the military could lock us in, quell any rebellion. And if the monkeys ever went crazy and tried to break out of their cage, the air force could fly over and bomb the shit out of everyone. ([Location 437](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01DHWACVY&location=437))
- Their fathers were off working in a mine somewhere, able to come home only during the holidays. Their fathers had been sent to prison. Their fathers were in exile, fighting for the cause. Women held the community together. ([Location 551](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01DHWACVY&location=551))
- In America the dream is to make it out of the ghetto. In Soweto, because there was no leaving the ghetto, the dream was to transform the ghetto. ([Location 582](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01DHWACVY&location=582))
- Growing up the way I did, I learned how easy it is for white people to get comfortable with a system that awards them all the perks. I knew my cousins were getting beaten for things that I’d done, but I wasn’t interested in changing my grandmother’s perspective, because that would mean I’d get beaten, too. Why would I do that? So that I’d feel better? Being beaten didn’t make me feel better. I had a choice. I could champion racial justice in our home, or I could enjoy granny’s cookies. I went with the cookies. ([Location 743](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01DHWACVY&location=743))
- They were ready to do me violent harm, until they felt we were part of the same tribe, and then we were cool. That, and so many other smaller incidents in my life, made me realize that language, even more than color, defines who you are to people. ... Maybe I didn’t look like you, but if I spoke like you, I was you. ([Location 798](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01DHWACVY&location=798))
- I moved to the B classes with the black kids. I decided I’d rather be held back with people I liked than move ahead with people I didn’t know. ([Location 859](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01DHWACVY&location=859))
- My mother calls it “the black tax.” Because the generations who came before you have been pillaged, rather than being free to use your skills and education to move forward, you lose everything just trying to bring everyone behind you back up to zero. ([Location 934](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01DHWACVY&location=934))
- When I look back I realize she raised me like a white kid—not white culturally, but in the sense of believing that the world was my oyster, that I should speak up for myself, that my ideas and thoughts and decisions mattered. ([Location 1053](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01DHWACVY&location=1053))
- We tell people to follow their dreams, but you can only dream of what you can imagine, and, depending on where you come from, your imagination can be quite limited. ([Location 1055](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01DHWACVY&location=1055))
- Catholic school is similar to apartheid in that it’s ruthlessly authoritarian, and its authority rests on a bunch of rules that don’t make any sense. ([Location 1255](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01DHWACVY&location=1255))
- She taught me to challenge authority and question the system. The only way it backfired on her was that I constantly challenged and questioned her. ([Location 1258](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01DHWACVY&location=1258))
- The first thing I learned about having money was that it gives you choices. People don’t want to be rich. They want to be able to choose. The richer you are, the more choices you have. That is the freedom of money. ([Location 2431](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01DHWACVY&location=2431))
- What he did, on a small scale, showed me how important it is to empower the dispossessed and the disenfranchised in the wake of oppression. ([Location 2459](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01DHWACVY&location=2459))
- People always lecture the poor: “Take responsibility for yourself! Make something of yourself!” But with what raw materials are the poor to make something of themselves? ([Location 2463](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01DHWACVY&location=2463))
- People love to say, “Give a man a fish, and he’ll eat for a day. Teach a man to fish, and he’ll eat for a lifetime.” What they don’t say is, “And it would be nice if you gave him a fishing rod.” That’s the part of the analogy that’s missing. ([Location 2464](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01DHWACVY&location=2464))
- The hood made me realize that crime succeeds because crime does the one thing the government doesn’t do: crime cares. Crime is grassroots. Crime looks for the young kids who need support and a lifting hand. Crime offers internship programs and summer jobs and opportunities for advancement. Crime gets involved in the community. Crime doesn’t discriminate. ([Location 2722](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01DHWACVY&location=2722))
- It’s easy to be judgmental about crime when you live in a world wealthy enough to be removed from it. But the hood taught me that everyone has different notions of right and wrong, different definitions of what constitutes crime, and what level of crime they’re willing to participate in. ([Location 2776](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01DHWACVY&location=2776))
- Hustling is to work what surfing the Internet is to reading. If you add up how much you read in a year on the Internet—tweets, Facebook posts, lists—you’ve read the equivalent of a shit ton of books, but in fact you’ve read no books in a year. ([Location 2857](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01DHWACVY&location=2857))
- The biggest thing in the hood is that you have to share. You can’t get rich on your own. You have money? Why aren’t you helping people? The old lady on the block needs help, everyone pitches in. You’re buying beer, you buy beer for everyone. You spread it around. Everyone must know that your success benefits the community in one way or another, or you become a target. ([Location 2875](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01DHWACVY&location=2875))
- They came busting in wearing riot gear and pointing machine guns. That’s how our police roll. We don’t have small and then big. What Americans call SWAT is just our regular police. ([Location 2898](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01DHWACVY&location=2898))
- The tear gas had nothing to do with me or the music. Tear gas is just what the police use to shut down parties in black neighborhoods, like the club turning on the lights to tell everyone to go home. ([Location 2909](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01DHWACVY&location=2909))
- In society, we do horrible things to one another because we don’t see the person it affects. We don’t see their face. We don’t see them as people. Which was the whole reason the hood was built in the first place, to keep the victims of apartheid out of sight and out of mind. Because if white people ever saw black people as human, they would see that slavery is unconscionable. We live in a world where we don’t see the ramifications of what we do to others, because we don’t live with them. It would be a whole lot harder for an investment banker to rip off people with subprime mortgages if he actually had to live with the people he was ripping off. If we could see one another’s pain and empathize with one another, it would never be worth it to us to commit the crimes in the first place. ([Location 2924](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01DHWACVY&location=2924))
- My mom never gave me an inch. Anytime I got in trouble it was tough love, lectures, punishment, and hidings. Every time. For every infraction. You get that with a lot of black parents. __They’re trying to discipline you before the system does. “I need to do this to you before the police do it to you.”__ Because that’s all black parents are thinking from the day you’re old enough to walk out into the street, where the law is waiting. ([Location 2983](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01DHWACVY&location=2983))
- Cops in South Africa don’t give you a reason when they pull you over. Cops pull you over because they’re cops and they have the power to pull you over; it’s as simple as that. I used to watch American movies where cops would pull people over and say, “You didn’t signal” or “Your taillight’s out.” I’d always wonder, Why do American cops bother lying? One thing I appreciate about South Africa is that we have not yet refined the system to the point where we feel the need to lie. ([Location 3012](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01DHWACVY&location=3012))
- It’s the same way in America. If you’re poor, if you don’t know how the system works, you can slip through the cracks, and the next thing you know you’re in this weird purgatory where you’re not in prison but you’re not not in prison. You haven’t been convicted of any crime, but you’re still locked up and can’t get out. ([Location 3062](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01DHWACVY&location=3062))
- At a certain point it occurred to me that every single person in that cell might be faking it. We were all decent guys from nice neighborhoods and good families, picked up for unpaid parking tickets and other infractions. We could have been having a great time sharing meals, playing cards, and talking about women and soccer. But that didn’t happen, because everyone had adopted this dangerous pose and nobody talked because everyone was afraid of who the other guys were pretending to be. ([Location 3111](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01DHWACVY&location=3111))
- When you make the effort to speak someone else’s language, even if it’s just basic phrases here and there, you are saying to them, “I understand that you have a culture and identity that exists beyond me. I see you as a human being.” ([Location 3136](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01DHWACVY&location=3136))
- The world has been taught to be scared of him, but the reality is that he is scared of the world because he has none of the tools necessary to cope with it. ([Location 3153](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01DHWACVY&location=3153))
- you so much shit is because I love you. Everything I have ever done I’ve done from a place of love. If I don’t punish you, the world will punish you even worse. The world doesn’t love you. If the police get you, the police don’t love you. When I beat you, I’m trying to save you. When they beat you, they’re trying to kill you.” ([Location 3243](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01DHWACVY&location=3243))
- The way my mother always explained it, the traditional man wants a woman to be subservient, but he never falls in love with subservient women. He’s attracted to independent women. “He’s like an exotic bird collector,” she said. “He only wants a woman who is free because his dream is to put her in a cage.” ([Location 3370](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01DHWACVY&location=3370))
- I was nine years old, and I still thought of the police as the good guys. You get in trouble, you call the police, and those flashing red-and-blue lights are going to come and save you. But I remember standing there watching my mom, flabbergasted, horrified that these cops wouldn’t help her. That’s when I realized the police were not who I thought they were. They were men first, and police second. ([Location 3431](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01DHWACVY&location=3431))
- Growing up in a home of abuse, you struggle with the notion that you can love a person you hate, or hate a person you love. It’s a strange feeling. You want to live in a world where someone is good or bad, where you either hate them or love them, but that’s not how people are. ([Location 3601](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01DHWACVY&location=3601))
- “He thinks he’s the policeman of the world,” she said. “And that’s the problem with the world. We have people who cannot police themselves, so they want to police everyone else around them.” ([Location 3619](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01DHWACVY&location=3619))
