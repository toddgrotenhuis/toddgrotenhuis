## Highlights
### PREFACE
- I want to reclaim the concept of prepping from the hands of the bunker-dwelling prophets of doom. Prepping shouldn’t be about expecting the apocalypse; it should be about enjoying life to the fullest without having to worry about what’s in the news.
### PART I
THINKING ABOUT RISK
#### 1
A METHOD TO THE MADNESS
- when tasked with analyzing very distant threats, the pursuit of novelty combined with the dearth of personal experiences pushes us toward the plots of the dramatic, action-packed novels we read, the films we watch, and the computer games we play. In the context of emergency preparedness, this can have us focusing on scenarios that are not merely rare, but might not even be real.
- The best way to build a robust taxonomy of unknown unknowns without getting bogged down by long-winded hypotheticals might be to take a critical look at your daily routine, stress-testing every external dependency by asking, “What would happen if I could no longer perform this task the usual way?”
- Since your resources are limited, another useful dimension to ponder is the minimum cost—in time, effort, and money—of mitigating a concern.
- When tallying the expenses, it’s also good to distinguish between costs that are recoverable and ones that aren’t. There’s no way to recoup the money spent on window bars if you suddenly need cash to pay for a new roof or cover an unexpected dental bill. In contrast, there’s almost no penalty to maintaining a rainy-day fund, as the money can almost always be reallocated
- In a 2016 essay, author Kevin Simler used this metaphor of corporate life to introduce the concept of what he called crony beliefs. He noted that much like the misguided line managers in our story, people instinctively judge beliefs on a one-dimensional scale, essentially placing them somewhere between right and wrong, and expecting any conviction that’s proven false to immediately vanish in a puff of cognitive smoke. But to Simler, no biological imperative exists for any of us to hold only true opinions; our belief system, he argues, is far more utilitarian, and other dimensions make convictions desirable (and sincere), even if they don’t hold up to scientific scrutiny.

- But a second class of convictions—Simler’s crony beliefs—also exists and serves a very different purpose: helping people thrive within communities. Such beliefs aren’t always about conformity. In some settings, one might be rewarded for taking provocative and contrarian positions to build a reputation as an independent thinker.
- Our popular culture is replete with doomsday predictions that extrapolate from worst-case assumptions and take a uniquely dim view of our species’ ability to adapt and overcome.

THE SPECTER OF HUMDRUM CALAMITIES
- lifestyle creep: the tendency to scale up small, everyday purchasing decisions in proportion to one’s income.

- As with many other risks, a robust financial safety net can take care of many concerns, but so do other, more easily implemented measures, such as being on good terms with family members, friends, or coworkers, and agreeing that you can crash at each other’s place in an emergency. Another simple strategy is having some bare necessities—clothing, cash, documents—stowed away at your workplace or another secure location not far from home.
- More than for many other topics discussed in this chapter, most effectual approaches to managing the risk of unintentional injury involve changing everyday habits rather than trying to respond to a disaster that’s already in motion.
- And because being assaulted is a dynamic situation that can quickly spiral out of control, well-rehearsed situational awareness and robust de-escalation skills are key to reducing this risk.

EXPLORING LARGE-SCALE RISKS
- The US federal government provides useful resources too. For example, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) maintains street-resolution flood-risk maps for most of the country. You can find the maps at https://msc.fema.gov/portal/home. Similarly, the US Geological Survey (USGS) provides fairly detailed maps of seismic faults, earthquake probabilities, and soil instability risks for some metro areas. These resources can be explored at https://www.usgs.gov/natural-hazards/earthquake-hazards/seismic-hazard-maps-and-site-specific-data/.
