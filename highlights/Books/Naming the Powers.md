## Highlights
- Every Power tends to have a visible pole, an outer form-be it a church, a nation, or an economy-and an invisible pole, an inner spirit or driving force that animates, legitimates, and regulates its physical manifestation in the world. Neither pole is the cause of the other. ([Location 113](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004WMSF7M&location=113))
- These Powers are both heavenly and earthly, divine and human, spiritual and political, invisible and structural. ([Location 182](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004WMSF7M&location=182))
- These Powers are also both good and evil. ([Location 192](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004WMSF7M&location=192))
- For the purposes of this discussion the two terms arche and archon may be taken together, since archd so often verges on the sense of archon in the New Testament. ([Location 198](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004WMSF7M&location=198))
- Archt is a more abstract term for power, the presociological word for the institutionalization and continuity of power through office, position, or role, although occasionally (as in the New Testament… ([Location 200](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004WMSF7M&location=200))
- Arch- simply denotes the organization of power. It was compounded with other terms to form the title of virtually every conceivable office. Most frequently it denotes the role or position which an incumbent (archon) filled, such as town clerk (archigrammateus) or head jailer (archidesmophylax, Gen. 39:21, LXX); occasionally it could extend to the place where the role was… ([Location 203](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004WMSF7M&location=203))
- The fact that almost every extant pre-Christian use of archt and archon refers to the role played by some human agent in the exercise of office should caution us against assuming too quickly that their use in the New… ([Location 213](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004WMSF7M&location=213))
- It is within this language-world that arche and arch6n were occasionally used to designate spiritual powers, good or evil. It was far from the case that these terms primarily referred to spiritual entities; to the contrary, these terms could be extended to take in spiritual powers because they were the normal terms for power in all its manifestations. The world of the ancients was not a physical planet spinning in empty space in rotation around a nuclear reactor called the sun; it was a single continuum of heaven and earth, in which spiritual beings were as much at home as… ([Location 217](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004WMSF7M&location=217))
- We find in the use of exousia the same general pattern that held for archt and arch6n. The vast majority of references are to human arrangements of power, with an… ([Location 224](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004WMSF7M&location=224))
- But the single most significant fact about exousia as a term for power is that 85 percent of its uses refer to a structural dimension ofexistence, that permission or authorization provided by some legitimate authorizing person or body. In other words, the exousiai in the New Testament are, in the vast majority of cases, not spiritual beings but… ([Location 228](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004WMSF7M&location=228))
- In Jewish sources of the period, dynamis is most often used of military or political power or forces (a "host" or army, military might, or political clout). ([Location 246](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004WMSF7M&location=246))
- Consequently we encounter the term as denoting evil spirits, the spirits of the dead, stars, spiritual powers, Godhead, and delegated authority (Appendix 3). In the New Testament, and increasingly in later Christian writers, both orthodox and gnostic, the "Powers" are no longer so much God's agents as God's enemies. The "Lord of… ([Location 252](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004WMSF7M&location=252))
