## Highlights
- To be missional is to enter into the invitation of God to participate in His work of redemption and restoration of all creation through the transformation into His Body through His death, resurrection and ascension. ([Location 37](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00A095SBW&location=37))
- We are ruthlessly committed to people over programs, demanding that the latter always serve the former or it will be abandoned. ([Location 62](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00A095SBW&location=62))
- We cooperate, not compete, seeking not to win the praise or demand the submission of others. ([Location 63](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00A095SBW&location=63))
- Neither do we serve buildings and budgets, but they must serve us as we serve God through serving others. ([Location 64](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00A095SBW&location=64))
- We seek our greatness in our pursuit of becoming servants. ([Location 65](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00A095SBW&location=65))
- Each among us is our leader, each among us is led, mutually submitting to one another as circumstances require. ([Location 66](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00A095SBW&location=66))
- We honour the diversity of our community by leading from along side or beneath, not from above. ([Location 67](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00A095SBW&location=67))
- Each among us is our teacher, each among us a student. We honour the wisdom of every individual, especially mindful of those on the margins, as Christ Himself identified with them. ([Location 68](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00A095SBW&location=68))
- Too often we talk about missions or missionaries as though it is a specialized for the chosen few rather than the universal vocation of every believer. ([Location 88](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00A095SBW&location=88))
