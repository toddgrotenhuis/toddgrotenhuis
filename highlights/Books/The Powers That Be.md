## Highlights
- But the Powers That Be are more than just the people who run things. They are the systems themselves, the institutions and structures that weave society into an intricate fabric of power and relationships. ([Location 50](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0036S4BUI&location=50))
- Often they do both good and evil at the same time. ([Location 60](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0036S4BUI&location=60))
- The congregation was not addressed directly but through the angel. The angel seemed to be the corporate personality of the church, its ethos or spirit or essence. ([Location 76](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0036S4BUI&location=76))
- People self-select into a certain congregation because they feel that its angel is compatible with their values. Hence the spirit of a church can remain fairly constant over decades, even centuries, though all the original members have long since departed. ([Location 82](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0036S4BUI&location=82))
- If we want to change those systems, we will have to address not only their outer forms, but their inner spirit as well. ([Location 88](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0036S4BUI&location=88))
- For the angel of an institution is not just the sum total of all that an institution is (which sociology is competent to describe); it is also the bearer of that institution’s divine vocation (which sociology is not able to discern). Corporations and governments are “creatures” whose sole purpose is to serve the general welfare. And when they refuse to do so, their spirituality becomes diseased. They become “demonic.” ([Location 99](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0036S4BUI&location=99))
- But if the demonic is the spirituality produced when the angel of an institution turns its back on its divine vocation, then I could not only believe in the demonic, I could point to its presence in everyday life. ([Location 103](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0036S4BUI&location=103))
- I had gone there to observe the Powers; I ended up their captive. ([Location 117](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0036S4BUI&location=117))
- Unjust systems perpetuate themselves by means of institutionalized violence. ([Location 124](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0036S4BUI&location=124))

- But we have repeatedly seen how those who fight domination with violence become as evil as those whom they oppose. ([Location 127](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0036S4BUI&location=127))
- I found myself reluctantly being pushed, simply by the logic of the inquiry, to a position of consistent nonviolence. ([Location 129](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0036S4BUI&location=129))
- Not that I would use violence, of course, but others might on my behalf. I began to realize that if violence was my last resort, then I was still enmeshed in the belief that violence saves. ([Location 131](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0036S4BUI&location=131))

- We live in a remarkable time, when entire nations have been liberated by nonviolent struggle; when miracles are openly declared, ([Location 159](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0036S4BUI&location=159))
- Jesus’ gospel is, I will argue, God’s answer to that system of domination. It offers an alternative more radical and thoroughgoing than any other in human history ([Location 168](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0036S4BUI&location=168))
- In a world sinking into ever-deeper injustice and violence, Jesus offers an alternative to the Domination System that just cries out to be tried. ([Location 174](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0036S4BUI&location=174))
- It sees spirit—the capacity to be aware of and responsive to God—at the core of every institution, every city, every nation, every corporation, every place of worship. ([Location 178](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0036S4BUI&location=178))
- But the spiritualist worldview is also reflected in those forms of Christian faith that place all the emphasis on getting to heaven when one leaves this “vale of tears.” ([Location 220](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0036S4BUI&location=220))
- This materialistic worldview has penetrated deeply even into many religious persons, causing them to ignore the spiritual dimensions of systems or the spiritual resources of faith. ([Location 230](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0036S4BUI&location=230))
- People want to believe that the world is more than a consumer’s paradise and that they themselves are more than food for worms. ([Location 292](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0036S4BUI&location=292))
- In the biblical view the Powers are at one and the same time visible and invisible, earthly and heavenly, spiritual and institutional ([Location 300](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0036S4BUI&location=300))
- fundamentalists treat the Powers as actual demonic beings in the air, largely divorced from their manifestations in the physical or political world (the theological worldview), and secularists deny that this spiritual dimension even exists (the materialistic worldview). ([Location 326](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0036S4BUI&location=326))
- we might think of “demons” as the actual spirituality of systems and structures that have betrayed their divine vocations. ([Location 343](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0036S4BUI&location=343))
- My main objection to personalizing demons is that by doing so, we give them a “body” or form separate from the physical and historical institutions through which we experience them. ([Location 348](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0036S4BUI&location=348))
- The issue is not whether we “believe” in them but whether we can learn to identify them in our actual, everyday encounters. ([Location 363](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0036S4BUI&location=363))
- When a particular Power becomes idolatrous—that is, when it pursues a vocation other than the one for which God created it and makes its own interests the highest good—then that Power becomes demonic. The spiritual task is to unmask this idolatry and recall the Powers to their created purposes in the world. ([Location 364](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0036S4BUI&location=364))
- the church must perform this task despite its being as fallen and idolatrous as any other institution in society. ([Location 370](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0036S4BUI&location=370))
- It is part of the church’s task to remind corporations and businesses that profit is not the “bottom line,” that as creatures of God they have as their divine vocation the achievement of human well-being ([Location 384](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0036S4BUI&location=384))
- The Powers are good. The Powers are fallen. The Powers must be redeemed. ([Location 396](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0036S4BUI&location=396))
- They are good by virtue of their creation to serve the humanizing purposes of God. They are all fallen, without exception, because they put their own interests above the interests of the whole. And they can be redeemed, because what fell in time can be redeemed in time. ([Location 403](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0036S4BUI&location=403))
- Temporally: the Powers were created, they are fallen, and they shall he redeemed. ([Location 405](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0036S4BUI&location=405))
- By acknowledging that the Powers are good, bad, and salvageable—all at once—we are freed from the temptation to demonize those who do evil. ([Location 424](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0036S4BUI&location=424))
- To assert with Colossians 1:15–20 that God created the Powers does not imply that God endorses any particular Power at any given time. ([Location 428](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0036S4BUI&location=428))
- Some institutions and ideologies such as Nazism or sexism can be transformed only by being abandoned or destroyed and replaced by forms of governance or gender relations that are more true to God’s intent. ([Location 430](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0036S4BUI&location=430))
- To say that the Powers are created in, through, and for the humanizing purposes of God, then, does not imply divine endorsement of systems that have been overcome by evil ([Location 432](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0036S4BUI&location=432))
- Naming the Powers identifies our experiences of these pervasive forces that dominate our lives. Unmasking the Powers takes away their invisibility, and thus their capacity to coerce us unconsciously into doing their bidding. Engaging the Powers involves joining in God’s endeavor to bend them back to their divine purposes. ([Location 435](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0036S4BUI&location=435))

- The task of redemption is not restricted to changing individuals, then, but also to changing their fallen institutions. ([Location 443](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0036S4BUI&location=443))
- Redemption means actually being liberated from the oppression of the Powers, being forgiven both for one’s own sin and for complicity with the Powers, and setting about liberating the Powers themselves from their bondage to idolatry. ([Location 448](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0036S4BUI&location=448))
- Domination System. In that system, even Powers that directly compete with each other for territory or markets preserve the system by the very interactions by which they try to destroy each other. Like a massive family system, no institution or organization is allowed to “get better” without repercussions from other, more pathological Powers. The Domination System does not permit deviations from its values. If we are to take seriously the redemption of the Powers, we must follow their track into the labyrinth of the Domination System. ([Location 456](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0036S4BUI&location=456))
- These new Powers emanated from the huge institutions and bureaucracies that were concentrating increasing power over the day-to-day lives of ordinary people. ([Location 479](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0036S4BUI&location=479))
- This overarching network of Powers is what we are calling the Domination System. It is characterized by unjust economic relations, oppressive political relations, biased race relations, patriarchal gender relations, hierarchical power relations, and the use of violence to maintain them all. ([Location 488](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0036S4BUI&location=488))
- Defense against a powerful aggressor required a society to become more like the society that threatened it. ([Location 514](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0036S4BUI&location=514))
- The story that the rulers of domination societies told each other and their subordinates is what we today might call the Myth of Redemptive Violence. It enshrines the belief that violence saves, that war brings peace, that might makes right. ([Location 523](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0036S4BUI&location=523))
- If a god is what you turn to when all else fails, violence certainly functions as a god. ([Location 527](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0036S4BUI&location=527))

- In short, the Myth of Redemptive Violence is the story of the victory of order over chaos by means of violence. ([Location 596](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0036S4BUI&location=596))
- The psychodynamics of the TV cartoon or comic book are marvelously simple: children identify with the good guy so that they can think of themselves as good. This enables them to project out onto the bad guy their own repressed anger, violence, rebelliousness, or lust, and then vicariously to enjoy their own evil by watching the bad guy initially prevail. This segment of the show—the “Tammuz” element, where the hero suffers—actually consumes all but the closing minutes, allowing ample time for indulging the violent side of the self. When the good guy finally wins, viewers are then able to reassert control over their own inner tendencies, repress them, and reestablish a sense of goodness without coming to any insight about their own inner evil. The villain’s punishment provides catharsis; one forswears the villain’s ways and heaps condemnation on him in a guilt-free orgy of aggression. Salvation is found through identification with the hero. ([Location 611](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0036S4BUI&location=611))
- Furthermore, its orientation toward evil is one into which virtually all modern children (boys especially) are socialized in the process of maturation. Children select this mythic structure because they have already been led, by culturally reinforced cues and role models, to resonate with its simplistic view of reality. ([Location 661](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0036S4BUI&location=661))
- By making violence pleasurable, fascinating, and entertaining, the Powers are able to delude people into compliance with a system that is cheating them of their very lives. ([Location 665](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0036S4BUI&location=665))

- Once children have been indoctrinated into the expectations of a dominator society, they may never outgrow the need to locate all evil outside themselves. ([Location 666](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0036S4BUI&location=666))
- Adolescents are also enticed by video games, which accustom players to the notion that they will inevitably be “killed,” and can delay the reckoning only by “killing” as many of their opponents as possible on their way out. ([Location 689](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0036S4BUI&location=689))
- In this myth, the survival and welfare of the nation becomes the highest earthly and heavenly good. ([Location 704](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0036S4BUI&location=704))
- Not only does this myth establish a patriotic religion at the heart of the state, it gives divine sanction to that nation’s imperialism. The myth of redemptive violence thus serves as the spirituality of militarism. By divine right the state has the power to demand that its citizens sacrifice their lives to maintain the privileges enjoyed by the few. By divine decree it utilizes violence to cleanse the world of enemies of the state. Wealth and prosperity are the right of those who rule in such a state. And the name of God—any god, the Christian God included—can be invoked as having specially blessed and favored the supremacy of the chosen nation and its ruling caste. ([Location 705](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0036S4BUI&location=705))
- every Power has an inner spirituality as well as outer institutional forms. ([Location 715](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0036S4BUI&location=715))
- The myth of redemptive violence serves as the inner spirituality of the national security state. It provides divine legitimation for the suppression of poor people everywhere, and the extraction of wealth from the poorer nations. ([Location 716](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0036S4BUI&location=716))

- Though these idolaters of the state never tire of speaking about the democracy and Christianity that they are defending, in fact they put their faith in redemptive violence. ([Location 720](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0036S4BUI&location=720))
- This national security type of church is nothing more than the compromised court chaplain of the national security state. ([Location 739](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0036S4BUI&location=739))
- Why do the oppressed submit to such a myth? Why, for example, do American blue-collar workers, who are among those most victimized by the ruling elite, continue not only to support their oppressors but to be among their most vociferous fans? ([Location 742](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0036S4BUI&location=742))
- One reason they put up with it is the promise of salvation. ([Location 745](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0036S4BUI&location=745))
- Salvation through identification: whether it be in cartoon shows or westerns or confrontations with foreign powers, one’s personal well-being is tied inextricably to the fortunes of the hero-leader. ([Location 752](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0036S4BUI&location=752))
- For the alternative—ownership of one’s own evil and acknowledgment of God in the enemy—is for many simply too alien a concept. ([Location 754](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0036S4BUI&location=754))
- But from a Christian point of view, true patriotism acknowledges God’s sovereignty over all the nations, and holds a healthy respect for God’s judgments on the pretensions of any power that seeks to impose its will on others. ([Location 774](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0036S4BUI&location=774))
- Israel’s long pilgrimage out of domination began at the Exodus from Egypt and was refined by the prophets. Then the prophetic vision of a domain freed from the ravages of war—of swords beaten into plowshares—reached its greatest clarity in Jesus. He gave it profound programmatic shape in his teaching of nonviolence. In his Beatitudes, in his extraordinary concern for the outcasts and marginalized, in his wholly unconventional treatment of women, in his love of children, in his rejection of the belief that high-ranking men are the favorites of God, in his subversive proclamation of a new order in which domination will give way to compassion and communion, Jesus brought to fruition the prophetic longing for the “kingdom of God”—an expression we might paraphrase as “God’s domination-free order.” ([Location 787](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0036S4BUI&location=787))

- Almost every sentence Jesus uttered was an indictment of the Domination System or the disclosure of an alternative to it. ([Location 793](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0036S4BUI&location=793))
- In his beatitudes, his healings, and his table fellowship with outcasts and sinners, Jesus declared God’s special concern for the oppressed. ([Location 809](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0036S4BUI&location=809))
- economic inequities are the basis of domination. ([Location 820](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0036S4BUI&location=820))
- Since the powerful are not likely to abdicate their wealth, the poor must find ways to overcome the Domination Epoch from within. ([Location 822](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0036S4BUI&location=822))
- In parable after parable, Jesus speaks of the “reigning of God” using images drawn from farming and women’s work, not warfare and kings’ palaces. It is not described as coming from on high down to earth; it rises quietly and imperceptibly put of the land. It is established, not by armies and military might, but by an ineluctable process of growth from below, among the common people. ([Location 833](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0036S4BUI&location=833))

- A society with an unfair distribution of goods requires violence. Violence is the only way some are able to deprive others of what is justly theirs.

- we can now see that in every single encounter with women in the four Gospels, Jesus violated the customs of his time. ([Location 859](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0036S4BUI&location=859))
- The Domination System tenuously maintains the upper hand; shattering its hold at any single point threatens its stability all along the line. ([Location 879](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0036S4BUI&location=879))
- The church’s defection from the new order inaugurated for women must not blind us to the significance of what Jesus accomplished. Humanity has scarcely begun ([Location 907](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0036S4BUI&location=907))
- Jesus treated women as he did, not because he was “gallant” or “nice,” but because the restoration of women to their full humanity in partnership with men is integral to the coming of God’s domination-free order. ([Location 909](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0036S4BUI&location=909))

- But if God’s wrath does not need to be placated by blood, if God is a loving parent who forgives us even before we repent, then the entire sacrificial enterprise—the largest single industry in all of Palestine, employing thousands of workers—was rendered null and void. ([Location 994](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0036S4BUI&location=994))
- The church understood Jesus’ death as a sacrifice to end all sacrifices, the final sacrifice that exposed sacrificing as a perversion of God’s will. ([Location 996](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0036S4BUI&location=996))
- But if a mere Galilean artisan has withstood the entire Domination System and has prevailed, then the power of the Powers is not, after all, ultimate. ([Location 999](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0036S4BUI&location=999))
- He was not a reformer, bringing alternative, better readings of the law. Nor was he a revolutionary, attempting to replace one oppressive power with another ([Location 1003](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0036S4BUI&location=1003))

- What killed Jesus was not irreligion, but religion itself; not lawlessness, but precisely the Law; not anarchy, but the upholders of order. ([Location 1026](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0036S4BUI&location=1026))
- Girard understands the Hebrew Bible as a long and laborious exodus out of the world of violence, an exodus plagued by repeated reversals. ([Location 1034](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0036S4BUI&location=1034))
- This violence is in part the residue of false ideas about God carried over from the general human past. It is also, however, the beginning of a process of raising the scapegoating mechanism to consciousness, so that these projections on God can be withdrawn. ([Location 1042](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0036S4BUI&location=1042))
- In Israel, for the first time in human history, God begins to be seen as identified with the victims of violence ([Location 1043](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0036S4BUI&location=1043))
- that the scapegoat mechanism is fully exposed and revoked. Here at last, Girard asserts, is an entire collection of books written from the point of view of the victims. Scripture rehabilitates persecuted sufferers. God is revealed, not as demanding sacrifice, but as taking the part of the sacrificed. From Genesis to Revelation, the victims cry for justice and deliverance from the world of violence, where they are made scapegoats. In the cross these cries find vindication. ([Location 1056](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0036S4BUI&location=1056))
- The enemy of the state and of religion is, in fact, an innocent victim. ([Location 1064](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0036S4BUI&location=1064))
- The earliest Epistles and all the Gospels had attested that Jesus was executed by the Powers. ([Location 1072](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0036S4BUI&location=1072))
- Rather than God triumphing over the Powers through Jesus’ nonviolent self-sacrifice on the cross, the Powers disappear from discussion, and God is involved in a transaction wholly within God’s own self. But what is wrong with this God, whose legal ledgers can be balanced only by means of the death of an innocent victim? Jesus simply declared people forgiven, confident that he spoke the mind of God (Mark 2:1–12). Why, then, is a sacrificial victim necessary to make forgiveness possible? Doesn’t the death of Jesus reveal that all such sacrifices are unnecessary? ([Location 1078](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0036S4BUI&location=1078))
- For Paul, Christ is the end of sacrificing and the revelation of the scapegoat mechanism, ([Location 1083](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0036S4BUI&location=1083))
- Paul has apparently been unable fully to distinguish the insight that Christ is the end of sacrificing from the idea that Christ is the final sacrifice whose death is an atonement to God. And Christianity has suffered from this confusion ever since. ([Location 1087](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0036S4BUI&location=1087))
- The “Christus Victor” (“Christ Is Victor”) theory of the atonement proclaimed release of the captives to those who had formerly been deluded and enslaved by the Domination System. And it portrayed Jesus as set against that system with all his might. ([Location 1101](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0036S4BUI&location=1101))
- The Christus Victor theology fell out of favor, not because of intrinsic inadequacies, but because it was subversive to the church’s role as state religion. ([Location 1106](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0036S4BUI&location=1106))

- Before we reach the age of choice, our choices have already been to a high degree made for us by a system indifferent to our uniqueness. ([Location 1113](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0036S4BUI&location=1113))
- Christianity has, on the whole, succeeded no more than Judaism in unmasking the violence at the core of society. Its accommodation to power politics through the infinitely malleable ideology of the just war, its abandonment of the Christus Victor theory of the atonement for the blood theory, its projection of the reign of God into an afterlife or the remote future—all this gutted the church’s message of its most radical elements Jesus was made divine. The Mass (in the theology of the Council of Trent) became a perpetual sacrifice rather than the end of all need for sacrifice. And all Jews were scapegoated for the death of Jesus, so that the cycle of scapegoating was set loose to run its violent course again. ([Location 1116](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0036S4BUI&location=1116))
- The Domination System grows out of the fundamental belief that violence must be used to overcome violence. ([Location 1123](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0036S4BUI&location=1123))

- Wherever the gospel is truly heard, the scapegoat mechanism is rendered impotent, the persecutors’ reports of their official actions are no longer believed, and the Powers’ involvement in the execution of innocent victims is unmasked as judicial murder. ([Location 1124](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0036S4BUI&location=1124))
- Why, then, was a redemptive act necessary? Because our resentment toward God and our will to kill leave us unable to turn to God. ([Location 1133](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0036S4BUI&location=1133))
- if God loves us unconditionally, there is no need to seek conditional love from the various Powers who promise us rewards in return for devotion. ([Location 1138](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0036S4BUI&location=1138))
- Either we learn to stop the spiral of violence and scapegoating, or, having been stripped of the scapegoating mechanism as an outlet for our violence, we will consume ourselves in an apocalypse of fire. ([Location 1146](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0036S4BUI&location=1146))
- we are liberated, not by striking back at what enslaves us—for even striking back reveals that we are still controlled by violence—but by a willingness to die rather than submit to its command. ([Location 1150](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0036S4BUI&location=1150))
- Thus, dying to one’s ego can be just another false spirituality unless it involves dying to the Powers. ([Location 1183](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0036S4BUI&location=1183))
- This is one reason why Christians worship. To worship means to remember Who owns the house. ([Location 1195](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0036S4BUI&location=1195))
- The traditional interpretation of “do not resist an evildoer” has been nonresistance to evil—an odd conclusion, given the fact that on every occasion Jesus himself resisted evil with every fiber of his being.

- But the gospel does not teach nonresistance to evil. Jesus counsels resistance, but without violence. The Greek word translated “resist” in Matt. 5:39 is antistenai, meaning literally to stand (stenai) against (anti). What translators have over looked is that antistenai is most often used in the Greek version of the Old Testament as a technical term for warfare. It describes the way opposing armies would march toward each other until their ranks met. Then they would “take a stand,” that is, fight. Ephesians 6:13 uses precisely this imagery: “Therefore take up the whole armor of God, so that you may be able to withstand [antistenai] on that evil day, and having done everything, to stand firm [stenai].” The image is pot of a punch-drunk boxer somehow managing to stay on his feet, but of soldiers standing their ground, refusing to flee. In short, antistenai means more here than simply to “resist” evil. It means to resist violently, to revolt or rebel, to engage in an armed insurrection. ([Location 1225](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0036S4BUI&location=1225))
- The Bible translators working in the hire of King James on what came to be known as the King James Version knew that the king did not want people to conclude that they had any recourse against his or any other sovereign’s tyranny. ([Location 1232](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0036S4BUI&location=1232))
- Jesus is not telling us to submit to evil, but to refuse to oppose it on its own terms. We are not to let the opponent dictate the methods of our opposition. He is urging us to transcend both passivity and violence by finding a third way, one that is at once assertive and yet nonviolent. The correct translation would be the one still preserved in the earliest renditions of this saying found in the New Testament epistles: “Do not repay evil for evil” (Rom. 12:17; 1 Thes. 5:15; 1 Pet. 3:9). The Scholars Version of Matt. 5:39a is superb: “Don’t react violently against the one who is evil.” ([Location 1238](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0036S4BUI&location=1238))

- By turning the cheek, the servant makes it impossible for the master to use the backhand again: his nose is in the way. ([Location 1254](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0036S4BUI&location=1254))
- This act of defiance renders the master incapable of asserting his dominance in this relationship. He can have the slave beaten, but he can no longer cow him. ([Location 1257](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0036S4BUI&location=1257))

- He is telling impoverished debtors, who have nothing left but the clothes on their backs, to use the system against itself. ([Location 1274](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0036S4BUI&location=1274))
- However, exorbitant interest (25 to 250 percent) could be used to drive landowners ever deeper into debt. And debt, coupled with the high taxation required by Herod Antipas to pay Rome tribute, created the economic leverage to pry Galilean peasants loose from their land. By the time of Jesus we see this process already far advanced: large estates owned by absentee landlords, managed by stewards, and worked by tenant farmers, day laborers, and slaves. It is no accident that the first act of the Jewish revolutionaries in 66 C.E. was to burn the temple treasury, where the record of debts was kept. ([Location 1278](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0036S4BUI&location=1278))
- Why, then, does Jesus counsel them to give over their undergarments as well? This would mean stripping off all their clothing and marching out of court stark naked! Nakedness was taboo in Judaism, and shame fell less on the naked party than on the person viewing or causing the nakedness (Gen. 9:20–27). By stripping, the debtor has brought shame on the creditor. ([Location 1285](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0036S4BUI&location=1285))
- The entire system by which debtors are oppressed has been publicly unmasked. ([Location 1294](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0036S4BUI&location=1294))
- This unmasking is not simply punitive, since it offers the creditor a chance to see, perhaps for the first time in his life, what his practices cause, and to repent. ([Location 1295](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0036S4BUI&location=1295))
- The Powers That Be literally stand on their dignity. Nothing deflates them more effectively than deft lampooning. By refusing to be awed by their power, the powerless are emboldened to seize the initiative, even where structural change is not immediately possible. ([Location 1297](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0036S4BUI&location=1297))
- Whole villages sometimes fled to avoid being forced to carry soldiers’ baggage. ([Location 1313](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0036S4BUI&location=1313))
- The question here, as in the two previous instances, is how the oppressed can recover the initiative and assert their human dignity in a situation that cannot for the time being be changed. ([Location 1322](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0036S4BUI&location=1322))
- If he has enjoyed feeling superior to the vanquished, he will not enjoy it today. Imagine a Roman infantryman pleading with a Jew to give back his pack! ([Location 1331](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0036S4BUI&location=1331))
- Jesus does not encourage Jews to walk a second mile in order to build up merit in heaven, or to be pious, or to kill the soldier with kindness. He is helping an oppressed people find a way to protest and neutralize an onerous practice despised throughout the empire. He is not giving a nonpolitical message of spiritual world transcendence. He is formulating a worldly spirituality in which the people at the bottom of society or under the thumb of imperial power learn to recover their humanity. ([Location 1334](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0036S4BUI&location=1334))
- One could easily use Jesus’ advice vindictively. That is why we must not separate it from the command to love enemies that is integrally connected with it in both Matthew and Luke. ([Location 1337](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0036S4BUI&location=1337))
- Such tactics can seldom be repeated. One can imagine that within days after the incidents that Jesus sought to provoke the Powers That Be might pass new laws: penalties for nakedness in court and flogging for carrying a pack more than a mile. One must therefore be creative, improvising new tactics to keep the opponent off balance. ([Location 1340](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0036S4BUI&location=1340))
- They can begin to behave with dignity and recovered humanity now, even under the unchanged conditions of the old order. ([Location 1345](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0036S4BUI&location=1345))
- The reign of God is already breaking into the world, and it comes, not as an imposition from on high, but as the leaven slowly causing the dough to rise ([Location 1346](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0036S4BUI&location=1346))
- Here was indeed a way to resist the Powers That Be without being made over into their likeness. ([Location 1348](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0036S4BUI&location=1348))
- They could create within the shell of the old society the foundations of God’s domination-free order. They could begin living as if the Reign of God were already arriving. ([Location 1354](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0036S4BUI&location=1354))
- To an oppressed people, Jesus is saying, Do not continue to acquiesce in your oppression by the Powers; but do not react violently to it either. Rather, find a third way, a way that is neither submission nor assault, flight nor fight, a way that can secure your human dignity and begin to change the power equation, even now, before the revolution.

- These are, of course, not rules to be followed legalistically, but examples to spark an infinite variety of creative responses in new and changing circumstances. They break the cycle of humiliation with humor and even ridicule, exposing the injustice of the system. They recover for the poor a modicum of initiative that can force the oppressor to see them in a new light. ([Location 1360](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0036S4BUI&location=1360))

- liberate the oppressed from evil even as it frees the oppressor from sin. ([Location 1367](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0036S4BUI&location=1367))
- Jesus, in short, abhors both passivity and violence. He articulates, out of the history of his own people’s struggles, a way by which evil can be opposed without being mirrored, the oppressor resisted without being emulated, and the enemy neutralized without being destroyed.
