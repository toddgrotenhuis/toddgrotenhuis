## Highlights
- If white Americans could look at the terror they inflicted on their own black population—slavery, segregation, and lynching—then they might be able to understand what is coming at them from others. Black people know something about terror because we have been dealing with legal and extralegal white terror for several centuries. Nothing was more terrifying than the lynching tree. ([Location 268](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005M1ZIGI&location=268))
- That God could “make a way out of no way” in Jesus’ cross was truly absurd to the intellect, yet profoundly real in the souls of black folk. ([Location 311](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005M1ZIGI&location=311))
- There was no place for the proud and the mighty, for people who think that God called them to rule over others. The cross was God’s critique of power—white power—with powerless love, snatching victory out of defeat. ([Location 318](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005M1ZIGI&location=318))
- Both the cross and the lynching tree represented the worst in human beings and at the same time “an unquenchable ontological thirst”[1] for life that refuses to let the worst determine our final meaning. ([Location 329](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005M1ZIGI&location=329))
- Initially, lynching was not directed primarily against blacks nor did it always mean death to the victim. Mexicans, Indians, Chinese, and whites were lynched—a term that could apply to whipping, shooting, stabbing, as well as hanging. Lynching was an extralegal punishment sanctioned by the community. ([Location 335](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005M1ZIGI&location=335))
- As communities moved westward out of reach of the courts, Judge Lynch was invoked to punish rustlers, robbers, wife abusers, and others who committed what a community perceived as outrageous deeds. ([Location 338](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005M1ZIGI&location=338))
- Slaveholders whipped and raped slaves, violating them in any way they thought necessary, but they did not lynch them, except in the case of those who threatened the slave system itself, such as Gabriel Prosser, Denmark Vesey, Nat Turner, and other insurrectionists. ([Location 344](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005M1ZIGI&location=344))
- During the Reconstruction era, the South was divided into military districts, which provided blacks some protection from mob violence, so that the Klan had to do its violent work against blacks and their white northern sympathizers in secret, at night, wearing hoods to hide its members’ identity. ([Location 356](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005M1ZIGI&location=356))
- In the white imagination, the image of black men was transformed from docile slaves and harmless “Sambos,” to menacing “black beast rapists,” the most serious threat to the virtue of white women and the sanctity of the white home. The image of black women was changed from nurturing “Negro mammies” to salacious Jezebels, nearly as corrupting to white civilization as black men. ([Location 390](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005M1ZIGI&location=390))
- Sexual intercourse between black men and white women was regarded as the worst crime blacks could commit against Anglo-Saxon civilization. ([Location 408](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005M1ZIGI&location=408))
- On the other hand, black men’s assertion of their right to protect their daughters, sisters, wives, mothers, and other women from unwelcome advances from white men could bring down the full weight of Judge Lynch. ([Location 417](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005M1ZIGI&location=417))
- Threats of lynching were often more effective than the act itself. ([Location 419](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005M1ZIGI&location=419))
- Burning the black victim slowly for hours was the chief method of torture. ([Location 432](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005M1ZIGI&location=432))
- women and children were often given the first opportunity to torture black victims—burning black flesh and cutting off genitals, fingers, toes, and ears as souvenirs. ([Location 436](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005M1ZIGI&location=436))
- Even to look at white people in a manner regarded as disrespectful could get a black lynched. ([Location 477](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005M1ZIGI&location=477))
- Unemployed blacks passing through an area with no white man to vouch for them could easily find themselves on a prison chain gang or swinging from a lynching tree. ([Location 478](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005M1ZIGI&location=478))
- For most blacks it was the blues and religion that offered the chief weapons of resistance. ([Location 484](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005M1ZIGI&location=484))
- Both black religion and the blues offered sources of hope that there was more to life than what one encountered daily in the white man’s world. ([Location 486](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005M1ZIGI&location=486))
- To be able to speak back to the tragedy of lynching in the blues song was partly to overcome its terror. But the singing of the blues was also a way for ordinary working class and poor blacks to assert loudly and exuberantly their somebodiness, ([Location 536](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005M1ZIGI&location=536))
- The fear of lynching was so deep and widespread that most blacks were too scared even to talk publicly about it. ([Location 556](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005M1ZIGI&location=556))
- When an adult black male is treated like a child in a patriarchal society—with whites calling him “boy,” “uncle,” and “nigger”—proclaiming oneself a “man” is a bold and necessary affirmation of black resistance. ([Location 583](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005M1ZIGI&location=583))
- But it was risky for blacks to assert their humanity overtly during those times; it often had to be camouflaged in blues songs about sexuality at the juke joint. ([Location 586](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005M1ZIGI&location=586))
- If the blues offered an affirmation of humanity, religion offered a way for black people to find hope. ([Location 600](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005M1ZIGI&location=600))
- Unlike Kierkegaard and Job, however, blacks often refused to go down into that “loathsome void,” that “torment of despair,” where one “struggles with death but cannot die.” ([Location 640](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005M1ZIGI&location=640))
- When people do not want to be themselves, but somebody else, that is utter despair. ([Location 658](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005M1ZIGI&location=658))
- In the second version of “Nobody Knows,” the source of the hope is Jesus, for he is a friend who knows about the trouble of the little ones, and he is the reason for their “Hallelujah.” His divine presence is the most important message about black existence. ([Location 667](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005M1ZIGI&location=667))
- In the mystery of God’s revelation, black Christians believed that just knowing that Jesus went through an experience of suffering in a manner similar to theirs gave them faith that God was with them, even in suffering on lynching trees, just as God was present with Jesus in suffering on the cross. ([Location 674](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005M1ZIGI&location=674))
- The more black people struggled against white supremacy, the more they found in the cross the spiritual power to resist the violence they so often suffered. ([Location 690](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005M1ZIGI&location=690))
- faith was the one thing white people could not control or take away. ([Location 694](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005M1ZIGI&location=694))
- If the God of Jesus’ cross is found among the least, the crucified people of the world, then God is also found among those lynched in American history. ([Location 705](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005M1ZIGI&location=705))
- One has to be a little mad, kind of crazy, to find salvation in the cross, victory in defeat, and life in death. This is why the meaning of the cross is intensely debated today, especially by secular and religious intellectuals who reject the absurd idea that a shameful, despicable death could “reveal” anything. ([Location 755](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005M1ZIGI&location=755))
- The resurrection of Jesus is God giving people meaning beyond history, when such violence as slavery and lynching seemed to close off any future. ([Location 765](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005M1ZIGI&location=765))
- Blacks did not embrace the cross, however, without experiencing the profound contradictions that slavery, segregation, and lynching posed for their faith. That was why most blacks left white churches during slavery to form their own places of worship. Leaving white churches helped blacks to find their own space for free religious and political expression, but it did not remove their need to wrestle with God about the deeply felt contradictions that slavery created for faith. ([Location 777](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005M1ZIGI&location=777))
- An’ de Bible say we must pray for we enemy. Drop down on you’ knee, brothers, an’ pray to God for all de crackers, an’ judges, an’ de courts, an’ solicitors, sheriffs, an’ police in de land.” ([Location 794](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005M1ZIGI&location=794))
- The spirituals were the soul of the movement, giving people courage to fight, and the church was its anchor, deepening its faith in the coming freedom for all. ([Location 809](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005M1ZIGI&location=809))
- To reflect on this failure is to address a defect in the conscience of white Christians and to suggest why African Americans have needed to trust and cultivate their own theological imagination. ([Location 1077](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005M1ZIGI&location=1077))
- Since human beings are finite, Niebuhr reasoned that we can never do anything apart from our interests, especially when we act collectively. ([Location 1097](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005M1ZIGI&location=1097))
- This “life in the manger ended upon the cross . . . [and we] might end there if we really emulated it.”[12] ([Location 1120](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005M1ZIGI&location=1120))
- In my view these latter views amount to a moral justification of slavery and Jim Crow. ([Location 1196](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005M1ZIGI&location=1196))
    - Note: Strange that he praisess him for realpolitik, but then complains at the horrific results of such things. They go hand in hand.
- groups are notoriously selfish and have limited capacity to step outside of their interests and see the world from another group’s standpoint. ([Location 1223](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005M1ZIGI&location=1223))
- The will-to-survive is so strong that it transmutes easily into the will-to-power. ([Location 1224](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005M1ZIGI&location=1224))
- Unlike Dietrich Bonhoeffer, who spent time in black communities despite only being in America for about a year, Niebuhr, in his sermon on Simon and the cross, missed an opportunity to move into the river of the black experience. ([Location 1352](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005M1ZIGI&location=1352))
- In the end, Christian realism was not only a source of Niebuhr’s radicalism but also of his conservatism. ([Location 1358](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005M1ZIGI&location=1358))
    - Note: Exactly
- Whites could kill blacks, knowing that a jury of their peers would free them but would convict and execute any black who dared to challenge the white way of life. ([Location 1381](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005M1ZIGI&location=1381))
- Niebuhr was speaking with a “rationality” that “belongs to cool observers,” and Baldwin was speaking to what “ought to be true; and may become true if its truth is not doubted.”[52] ([Location 1511](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005M1ZIGI&location=1511))
- What Niebuhr said about liberalism could be applied to his own perspective on racism: ([Location 1515](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005M1ZIGI&location=1515))
- When Niebuhr wrote against liberalism, pacifism, communism, and the easy conscience of American churches, he expressed outrage; but when it came to black victims of white supremacy, he expressed none.[53] ([Location 1517](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005M1ZIGI&location=1517))
- I do care that they have the power to keep me out of a home, out of a job, and to put my child on a needle. ([Location 1523](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005M1ZIGI&location=1523))
- I don’t care what they think or what they feel; I care about their power.” ([Location 1524](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005M1ZIGI&location=1524))
- King never spoke about proximate justice or about what was practically possible to achieve. That would have killed the revolutionary spirit in the African American community. ([Location 2229](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005M1ZIGI&location=2229))
- God’s justice called for black people to bear witness to freedom now, even unto death. ([Location 2239](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005M1ZIGI&location=2239))
- As King saw it, the most powerful religious authority for black Christians was Jesus Christ, and Jesus’ teachings on love and nonviolence became his primary focus: ([Location 2350](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005M1ZIGI&location=2350))
- Jesus’ life and death on a Roman cross spoke to the black condition as defined by the American lynching tree. ([Location 3608](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005M1ZIGI&location=3608))
- Wells herself regarded rape as an “unspeakable outrage,” and this initially inhibited her from speaking out forcefully against lynching. Yet the Memphis lynching had nothing to do with rape. What caused it was envy of black economic success. Whites tolerated no competition from blacks in anything, not even in sports such as baseball and horse racing, but especially in politics and economics. ([Location 3667](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005M1ZIGI&location=3667))
- For Wells, faith in the God of Calvary was not an excuse for passivity. She rebuked those who patiently waited on God to save them from injustice. ([Location 3719](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005M1ZIGI&location=3719))
- Faith and doubt were bound together, with each a check against the other—doubt preventing faith from being too sure of itself and faith keeping doubt from going down into the pit of despair. With faith in one hand and doubt in the other she contended against the evil of lynching. ([Location 3731](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005M1ZIGI&location=3731))
- White Christianity was not genuine because it either openly supported slavery, segregation, and lynching as the will of God or it was silent about these ([Location 3734](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005M1ZIGI&location=3734))
- She could have said the same thing about Reinhold Niebuhr, his brother H. Richard, Social Gospel theologian Walter Rauschenbusch, and the rest of white theologians and ministers during that time. All of them were silent, as if the meaning of the Christian gospel for America had nothing to do with segregation and lynching. ([Location 3740](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005M1ZIGI&location=3740))
- Wells was especially critical of evangelist Dwight Moody, who segregated his revivals to appease whites in the South. ([Location 3743](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005M1ZIGI&location=3743))
- “Our American Christians are too busy saving the souls of white Christians from burning in hellfire to save the lives of black ones from present burning in fires kindled by white Christians.” ([Location 3744](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005M1ZIGI&location=3744))

- There was no way a community could support or ignore lynching in America, while still representing in word and deed the one who was lynched by Rome. ([Location 3755](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005M1ZIGI&location=3755))
- Billie Holiday’s rendition of “Strange Fruit,” which she called “my personal protest,” was the most powerful resistance song against lynching. ([Location 3778](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005M1ZIGI&location=3778))
- How could white Christians reconcile the “strange fruit” they hung on southern trees with the “strange fruit” Romans hung on the cross at Golgotha? ([Location 3810](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005M1ZIGI&location=3810))
- No white person could listen to Billie’s “Strange Fruit” without feeling indicted and exposed by the sound of truth and contempt in her voice. She made whites look at the brutality they wanted to forget. That was why “Strange Fruit” was often banned from many radio stations and several clubs would not let Billie sing it, especially when whites walked out, claiming that it was not entertainment. ([Location 3825](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005M1ZIGI&location=3825))
- Just as the old slave spiritual “Were You There?” placed black Christians at the foot of Jesus’ cross, “Strange Fruit” put them at the foot of the lynching tree. Both songs created a dark and somber mood. One was sung in church and the other in a nightclub, but both addressed the deep-down hurt that blacks felt and gave them a way to deal with it. ([Location 3865](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005M1ZIGI&location=3865))
- The struggle to survive in a white supremacist society was a full-time occupation for black people. But how to survive with one’s dignity intact—that was the challenge. ([Location 3872](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005M1ZIGI&location=3872))
- Scholars who criticize blacks for their “otherworldly” religion should look a little deeper into the ways blacks resisted the demonic in their midst. ([Location 3886](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005M1ZIGI&location=3886))
- Yet, although black women’s struggles for survival might have been somewhat different from those of men, they were not any easier. ([Location 3888](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005M1ZIGI&location=3888))
- “Lynching makes a mockery of courts and citizenship. The state itself has been lynched.”[50] Thus, whites focused on the anarchy that lynching created for whites. They hardly said an adequate word about the devastating effect of the lynching atrocity in the black community. ([Location 3914](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005M1ZIGI&location=3914))
- Therefore, she urged, “Work as if all depends upon you. Pray as if all depends upon God.”[52] ([Location 3926](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005M1ZIGI&location=3926))
- While men talked, women walked and got things done. ([Location 3929](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005M1ZIGI&location=3929))
- While it has often been said that the civil rights movement was a religious movement and led by male ministers, that was only partly true. The civil rights movement was also a women’s movement. Women started it (“If Rosa Parks had not sat down, Martin Luther King Jr. would not have stood up”), sustained it through difficult times, and made religion its central focus through song—giving ([Location 3937](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005M1ZIGI&location=3937))
- Through their actions, women expressed the conviction that their nonviolent suffering could save not only the black community from white supremacy but even save America from its worst self. ([Location 3949](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005M1ZIGI&location=3949))
- Like other poor blacks, Hamer had no access to sophisticated biblical studies, and thus used a familiar evangelical hymn, popular in the black churches, to make her point about our responsibility to become an agent of change. ([Location 3955](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005M1ZIGI&location=3955))
- Dying for others was not unusual for black women, and they taught their sons and daughters to give back to the community, to give even their lives for freedom. Despite the dangers, they believed Jesus, their protector and friend, would walk with them and would see them through hard trials. ([Location 4014](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005M1ZIGI&location=4014))
- Like Martin Luther King Jr., black women throughout African American history not only preached the cross but bore it, and sometimes died on it. ([Location 4043](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005M1ZIGI&location=4043))
- Black Power also challenged young African American ministers to develop an understanding of the Christian gospel that would empower African Americans to affirm their black and Christian identity. ([Location 4046](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005M1ZIGI&location=4046))
- Black liberation theology emerged out of black people’s struggle with nonviolence (Christianity) and self-defense (Black Power). ([Location 4050](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005M1ZIGI&location=4050))
- According to Williams, Jesus did not come to save us through his death on the cross but rather he “came to show redemption through a perfect ministerial vision of righting relationships.”[70] ([Location 4059](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005M1ZIGI&location=4059))
- I accept Delores Williams’s rejection of theories of atonement as found in the Western theological tradition and in the uncritical proclamation of the cross in many black churches. I find nothing redemptive about suffering in itself. The gospel of Jesus is not a rational concept to be explained in a theory of salvation, but a story about God’s presence in Jesus’ solidarity with the oppressed, which led to his death on the cross. What is redemptive is the faith that God snatches victory out of defeat, life out of death, and hope out of despair, as revealed in the biblical and black proclamation of Jesus’ resurrection. ([Location 4064](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005M1ZIGI&location=4064))
- Interpreting the spirituals in “ ‘Wading through Many Sorrows’: Toward a Theology of Suffering in Womanist Perspective,” Copeland writes, If the makers of the spirituals gloried in singing of the cross of Jesus, it was not because they were masochistic and enjoyed suffering. Rather, the enslaved Africans sang because they saw on the rugged wooden planks One who had endured what was their daily portion. The cross was treasured because it enthroned the One who went all the way with them and for them. The enslaved African sang because they saw the results of the cross—triumph over the principalities and powers of death, triumph over evil in this world. ([Location 4076](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005M1ZIGI&location=4076))
- God’s liberation of the poor is the primary theme of Jesus’ gospel. ([Location 4475](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005M1ZIGI&location=4475))
- To live meaningfully, we must see light beyond the darkness. ([Location 4482](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005M1ZIGI&location=4482))
- The Christian gospel is God’s message of liberation in an unredeemed and tortured world. As such, it is a transcendent reality that lifts our spirits to a world far removed from the suffering of this one. ([Location 4486](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005M1ZIGI&location=4486))
- For all four, the revelatory moment in their lives helped to prepare them to face their deaths, sustained by the conviction that this was not the end but the beginning of a new life of meaning. ([Location 4491](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005M1ZIGI&location=4491))
- And yet the Christian gospel is more than a transcendent reality, more than “going to heaven when I die, to shout salvation as I fly.” It is also an immanent reality—a powerful liberating presence among the poor right now in their midst, “building them up where they are torn down and propping them up on every leaning side.” The gospel is found wherever poor people struggle for justice, fighting for their right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. ([Location 4494](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005M1ZIGI&location=4494))
- Without concrete signs of divine presence in the lives of the poor, the gospel becomes simply an opiate; rather than liberating the powerless from humiliation and suffering, the gospel becomes a drug that helps them adjust to this world by looking for “pie in the sky.” ([Location 4499](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005M1ZIGI&location=4499))
- And so the transcendent and the immanent, heaven and earth, must be held together in critical, dialectical tension, each one correcting the limits of the other. The gospel is in the world, but it is not of the world; that is, it can be seen in the black freedom movement, but it is much more than what we see in our struggles for justice. ([Location 4501](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005M1ZIGI&location=4501))
- The cross is the most empowering symbol of God’s loving solidarity with the “least of these,” the unwanted in society who suffer daily from great injustices. Christians must face the cross as the terrible tragedy it was and discover in it, through faith and repentance, the liberating joy of eternal salvation. ([Location 4509](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005M1ZIGI&location=4509))
- But we cannot find liberating joy in the cross by spiritualizing it, by taking away its message of justice in the midst of powerlessness, suffering, and death. The cross, as a locus of divine revelation, is not good news for the powerful, for those who are comfortable with the way things are, or for anyone whose understanding of religion is aligned with power. The religious authorities of Jesus’ time were threatened by his teachings about the reign of God’s justice and love, and the state authorities executed him as an insurrectionist—one who “perverts the nation” and “stirs up the people” ([Location 4511](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005M1ZIGI&location=4511))
- This reversal of expectations and conventional values is the unmistakable theme of the gospel. ([Location 4519](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005M1ZIGI&location=4519))
- He was crucified by the same principalities and powers that lynched black people in America. ([Location 4542](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005M1ZIGI&location=4542))
- When American Christians realize that they can meet Jesus only in the crucified bodies in our midst, they will encounter the real scandal of the cross. ([Location 4547](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005M1ZIGI&location=4547))
- What are we to make of the striking similarities between the brutality in Rome and cruelty in America? ([Location 4550](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005M1ZIGI&location=4550))
- One must suppose that in order to feel comfortable in the Christian faith, whites needed theologians to interpret the gospel in a way that would not require them to acknowledge white supremacy as America’s great sin.

- What is invisible to white Christians and their theologians is inescapable to black people. The cross is a reminder that the world is fraught with many contradictions—many lynching trees. ([Location 4565](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005M1ZIGI&location=4565))
- Nietzsche was right: Christianity is a religion of slaves. God became a slave in Jesus and thereby liberated slaves from being determined by their social condition. ([Location 4581](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005M1ZIGI&location=4581))
- The real scandal of the gospel is this: humanity’s salvation is revealed in the cross of the condemned criminal Jesus, and humanity’s salvation is available only through our solidarity with the crucified people in our midst. Faith that emerged out of the scandal of the cross is not a faith of intellectuals or elites of any sort. This is the faith of abused and scandalized people—the losers and the down and out.

- The cross needs the lynching tree to remind Americans of the reality of suffering—to keep the cross from becoming a symbol of abstract, sentimental piety. ... Yet the lynching tree also needs the cross, without which it becomes simply an abomination. It is the cross that points in the direction of hope, the confidence that there is a dimension to life beyond the reach of the oppressor.

- The lynching of black America is taking place in the criminal justice system where nearly one-third of black men between the ages of eighteen and twenty-eight are in prisons, jails, on parole, or waiting for their day in court.

- The death penalty is primarily reserved, though not exclusively, for people of color, and white supremacy shows no signs of changing it. That is why the term “legal lynching”[14] is still relevant today. One can lynch a person without a rope or tree.

- When I heard and read about the physical and mental abuse at the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq, I thought about lynching. The Roman Empire that killed Jesus at Calvary was similar to the American Empire that lynched blacks in the United States and also created the atrocities in Iraq and Afghanistan.

- Just as the Germans should never forget the Holocaust, Americans should never forget slavery, segregation, and the lynching tree. ([Location 4655](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005M1ZIGI&location=4655))
- If America has the courage to confront the great sin and ongoing legacy of white supremacy with repentance and reparation there is hope “beyond tragedy.” ([Location 4679](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005M1ZIGI&location=4679))
