## Highlights
### Foreword
- Our genetic makeup continues to prepare our bodies for food scarcity, making and storing fat whenever we are exposed to an abundance of carbohydrates, particularly fructose. In essence, we are constantly preparing for a winter that never comes. ([Location 168](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B097XMY9VG&location=168))
### INTRODUCTION The Birth of an Epidemic
- In the course of our research, we identified a biological process that animals use to help them survive. This process is most commonly triggered by the food they eat, of which fructose*—a common type of sugar in our diets—turns out to be especially important, although other foods stimulate it as well. We call it the survival switch, as it turns on a whole series of physical and metabolic changes, as well as behaviors, that protect animals in nature when food is not available. ([Location 316](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B097XMY9VG&location=316))

- One of the features of the switch is that it helps the animal store fat, which can be broken down to provide energy if no food is available. Many humans today have also turned on this switch, and keep it persistently on, with the result that we are now becoming fat. Hence, what was once a survival switch meant to protect us is now a fat switch driving obesity. ([Location 320](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B097XMY9VG&location=320))

- One of the central discoveries is that obesity is not the cause of these other conditions; rather, obesity and its associated diseases are all driven by the same underlying biological process, the survival switch. ([Location 324](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B097XMY9VG&location=324))
- I originally wrote about this switch in 2012 in The Fat Switch, but since then we have learned much more about how it works, what turns it on, and most excitingly, how to turn it off. ([Location 326](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B097XMY9VG&location=326))
- Although fructose present in sugars added to our food and beverages is the main culprit driving this program, we have identified other foods, and other factors, that turn on the survival switch. This research has yielded new insights into preventing and treating these diseases. Some treatments are already commonly used, such as low-carbohydrate diets and intermittent fasting. But we have also found other solutions that are not well known and typically have not been recommended. I am excited to discuss these new approaches with you in this book.

### PART I Why Nature Wants Us to Be Fat
#### CHAPTER 1 The Power of Fat
- Given what we’ve learned, it should not surprise you that being mildly overweight (a BMI of 27)* is associated with improved survival for people at risk for severe illness, such as cancer, heart disease, or kidney failure, and for individuals more than seventy years old. ([Location 456](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B097XMY9VG&location=456))
- I believe the reason that animals on a low-calorie diet live longer is that there is a cost to putting on fat. The food we eat is either broken down into immediate energy (which we call adenosine triphosphate, or ATP) or turned into stored energy (such as fat). Usually the calories we eat are turned into immediately available ATP. To instead store these calories for later, our cells must reduce the production of ATP and divert the excess calories to fat. Our research group determined that this is done through exposing the cells’ “energy factories” (also known as mitochondria), where most of the ATP is produced, to a phenomenon called oxidative stress. Thus, the cost of storing fat is some oxidative stress to our energy factories. If sustained for decades, this stress can lead to reduced function in—and even the loss of—these factories, which are responsible for the energy we need to maintain our bodies at full throttle. ([Location 469](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B097XMY9VG&location=469))
    - Tags: [[definition]] 
- Low-grade oxidative stress over time (such as from storing a lot of fat long term) is thought to be the underlying cause of aging, partly due to recurrent damage to our energy factories, which ages us faster. This is why reducing caloric intake can make you both look younger and live longer. ([Location 478](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B097XMY9VG&location=478))

- Given these considerations, there is not an ideal percentage of body fat that a person should have, as the optimal amount relates to the situation you are in. If you are skinny and keeping your caloric intake low in a society in which food is plentiful, you will likely do well and live long. However, if you have a chronic illness or are older, or if you do not always have good access to food, or if you are in a region at risk for famine, then it is better to have some extra fat on board. ([Location 493](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B097XMY9VG&location=493))
- Once a woman’s body fat falls below 15 percent, her ovaries’ ability to release eggs decreases and menstruation may stop; arrested menstruation and ovulation have also been observed in women with anorexia, ballet dancers, and marathon runners. Starvation also reduces sperm production in men. ([Location 519](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B097XMY9VG&location=519))
- Nature wants us to have sufficient fat to survive when situations are rough. To nature, obesity is not unnatural; it is not a disease. Fat is powerful, beneficial, and beautiful—at least in the right setting. ([Location 571](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B097XMY9VG&location=571))
#### CHAPTER 2 Secret Reasons It Helps to Be Fat
- The fat in the camel’s hump is there to make water. When fat is broken down, it provides not only the energy we need to survive, but also water. This is not because there is water in fat, but rather because burning fat generates water as one of its by-products. Accordingly, the state of a camel’s hump not only tells you how much fat it’s carrying, but also provides a clue as to its water reserves. When the hump is floppy, it is time to get the camel to a natural or artificial spring! This is true for evaluating the body fat in other animals, as well: if an animal appears lean and starving, it could be a sign not only that it needs food, but that it has not been able to find enough water, and had to burn fat to compensate. ([Location 647](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B097XMY9VG&location=647))
- The observation that fat is a source of metabolic water is rarely discussed in the medical literature, and certainly has been ignored by most investigators studying obesity. It is important to us, however, because it is additional evidence that fat plays a critical role in survival. ([Location 653](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B097XMY9VG&location=653))
    - Tags: [[definition]] 
- Naturalists have known for a long time that many animals living in the desert rely on their fat stores to provide metabolic water in times of need. This is a somewhat tricky task, since fat provides insulation that might raise body temperature. To prevent this, many desert mammals, including the kangaroo rat and the jerboa, carry most of their fat in their tails. This is also the reason the camel’s fat is stored on a hump on its back, where it does not increase the camel’s core temperature the way it would were it spread all over the body. ([Location 657](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B097XMY9VG&location=657))
- The need for metabolic water is also a reason marine mammals are commonly fat. The whale is the fattest animal in the world, and while some of the fat serves as insulation in the cold ocean environment, it is also a major source of water. This is because whales, dolphins, and seals do not drink seawater. They get some fresh water from the fish and invertebrates (such as krill) that they eat, and some whales may get a little water by eating ice, but up to one-third of their water comes from burning fat. ([Location 661](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B097XMY9VG&location=661))
- It seems that whenever animals have evolved in an environment where water is not readily available, they respond by carrying extra fat. ([Location 667](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B097XMY9VG&location=667))
- The clever way animals respond to food shortage is by making insulin less effective at moving glucose into muscle and the liver. With less glucose going into these tissues, levels in the blood rise, thereby ensuring sufficient glucose for the brain. This phenomenon is called insulin resistance. Insulin resistance is a major survival response in animals that lack food or water. ([Location 694](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B097XMY9VG&location=694))
- In nature, metabolic syndrome is an insurance plan. For humans today, metabolic syndrome is a disorder, a harbinger presaging the development of diabetes, high blood pressure, and heart disease. ([Location 717](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B097XMY9VG&location=717))
- And when glucose stores eventually run low, leading blood levels to fall, it uses breakdown products from fat called ketones to fuel the brain. ([Location 740](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B097XMY9VG&location=740))
- This process—whereby animals maintain a weight within a narrow range until a challenge to their survival activates various biological processes that let them put on additional fat—I call the __survival switch__. While the process is turned on and off like a switch, it can also be adjusted high or low, like a dimmer switch. ([Location 748](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B097XMY9VG&location=748))

- The main reason people are eating more today is that many of us, and especially those of us who are overweight or obese, tend to be hungrier than usual because we do not get a sensation of being full after we have eaten. ([Location 774](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B097XMY9VG&location=774))
- However, people who are overweight respond poorly to the leptin signal, something called leptin resistance, and so remain hungry longer. ([Location 778](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B097XMY9VG&location=778))
    - Tags: [[definition]] 
- People who are overweight also do not burn fat as well as those without excess fat. (We will learn more about what causes this later.) Since they burn less fat, adipose tissue tends to accumulate. Meanwhile, when you burn less fat, you convert less stored energy to readily usable energy, or ATP. Your cells sense when ATP levels are low, and interpret this as a low-energy state despite the total energy in the cell, including that from fat, being normal or high. There is some evidence that this can cause fatigue, and also hunger. This compounds the effects of leptin resistance, causing you to eat even more food, until your ATP levels finally rise high enough that your hunger is satisfied. However, the cost is having eaten more food and made more fat. ([Location 784](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B097XMY9VG&location=784))
- With the survival switch activated, it is as if we are continuously preparing for hibernation with no end in sight; unlike animals in the wild that turn this switch off when they fast or hibernate, our switch appears permanently jammed in the “on” position. And so long as this switch is on, we will continue to fight a losing battle against obesity and its related diseases. The survival switch has become a fat switch. ([Location 797](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B097XMY9VG&location=797))
#### CHAPTER 3 The Survival Switch
- There are also some sugars that do not contain fructose: for example, lactose (a combination of glucose and another simple sugar, galactose), the sugar present in milk. ([Location 841](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B097XMY9VG&location=841))
- Yet the hummingbird never gets diabetes complications. Why? Because it burns off the fat and blood glucose overnight; by morning, both the fat and the diabetes have disappeared. The hummingbird’s metabolism is so high that it needs this fat to survive while it sleeps. And if it runs out of fat stores during the night, it responds by slowing down its heart rate and breathing, much like a hibernating animal does. This allows the hummingbird to endure until the sun comes out and it can feed once more. ([Location 862](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B097XMY9VG&location=862))
- In Madagascar there is a fat-tailed dwarf lemur that hibernates in warm weather (something technically called estivation, meaning “to pass the summer”). ([Location 883](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B097XMY9VG&location=883))
    - Tags: [[definition]] 
- The findings were always the same: fructose causes weight gain primarily by stimulating calorie intake. ([Location 983](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B097XMY9VG&location=983))
- Fructose causes weight gain by encouraging increased food intake, but causes the other features of metabolic syndrome even when food intake remains the same. ([Location 1001](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B097XMY9VG&location=1001))
- Notably, the leptin resistance also persists for several weeks after the fructose in their diet is taken away. ([Location 1018](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B097XMY9VG&location=1018))
- The phenomenon of leptin resistance explains why feeding a high-fat diet to animals on fructose can cause dramatic weight gain. It also explains why a high-fat diet in the absence of fructose does not cause weight gain: the animals remain sensitive to the effects of leptin, and regulate their food intake accordingly.* ([Location 1024](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B097XMY9VG&location=1024))
- when we eat sweet foods, it triggers the release of dopamine ([Location 1034](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B097XMY9VG&location=1034))
- artificial sugars, such as sucralose, also generated a dopamine response in normal mice, the mice that could not taste sweetness no longer had a dopamine response. They also did not demonstrate any preference for it over regular water, the way the normal mice did. So there is something special about sucrose that results in pleasure even when its sweetness cannot be tasted. ([Location 1056](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B097XMY9VG&location=1056))
- By blocking fructose metabolism in specific organs in mice, while allowing fructose to be metabolized in other organs, he discovered that it was the liver that was fully responsible for how fructose causes obesity and metabolic syndrome. ([Location 1076](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B097XMY9VG&location=1076))
- What these studies suggest is that the metabolism of fructose through this special enzyme, fructokinase, may explain both why we prefer sugar and how fructose causes obesity and metabolic syndrome, but also that it does these two things through separate areas of the body. The preference for sugar is dependent on metabolism of fructose in the intestines, while fructose’s ability to cause obesity and insulin resistance stems from its metabolism in the liver. ([Location 1086](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B097XMY9VG&location=1086))
- Fructose metabolism is different. There is no check-and-balance system that protects the liver or other organs if ATP levels fall. Fructokinase breaks down fructose very rapidly, quickly using up ATP in the process, and so ATP levels can fall precipitously if a lot of fructose is being metabolized. The initial fall in ATP that occurs during fructose metabolism causes a chain reaction that keeps energy levels low. When ATP is used for energy, it gives up a phosphate to become ADP (adenosine diphosphate). ADP can be converted back to ATP, and this is what normally happens during the metabolism of glucose and other nutrients. However, when fructose is metabolized, the ADP is broken down into AMP (adenosine monophosphate), and then further metabolized to make uric acid. As ADP and AMP are removed to generate uric acid, the cell’s ability to remake ATP becomes impaired. ([Location 1102](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B097XMY9VG&location=1102))
- We subsequently learned that the uric acid formed from AMP also affects ATP levels in its own right. Specifically, it causes oxidative stress to the mitochondria, which further reduces their ability to make ATP while stimulating the production of fat. The oxidative stress caused by uric acid also blocks the burning of fatty acids released from stored fat. The net effect is that not only do the mitochondria make less ATP, but also the calories that would have been used to make ATP are now being stored as body fat. ([Location 1112](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B097XMY9VG&location=1112))
- When ATP levels fall in the cell, the body treats it as an emergency. It responds by stimulating hunger immediately.* This leads to increased food intake aimed at restoring ATP levels, among other biologic effects. However, due to the ongoing oxidative stress in the mitochondria, much of the calories end up being converted to fat—and if the food ingested includes fructose, it only exacerbates the issue, dropping ATP levels further and creating additional oxidative stress. Eventually, ATP levels recover, but by the time they do, much of the food we have eaten has been converted to fat. ([Location 1119](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B097XMY9VG&location=1119))
#### CHAPTER 4 Why We Are Becoming Fat
- At least two times in our history, our survival was linked not simply with fructose, but with lifesaving genetic mutations that gave us a winning combination: the ability to store more fat from less fructose. ([Location 1206](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B097XMY9VG&location=1206))
- However, these miracles come with a twist, for ironically, these same mutations are now a big part of the reason we humans are getting fat. ([Location 1209](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B097XMY9VG&location=1209))
- we narrowly survived extinction not once but twice in our past thanks to mutations that made us more sensitive to the effects of fructose than many other animals and therefore helped us store fat more effectively. ([Location 1318](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B097XMY9VG&location=1318))
- Many studies have shown that people who are overweight or who have metabolic syndrome tend to have lower blood levels of vitamin C. There are also studies that suggest increasing vitamin C intake reduces the risk for developing metabolic syndrome. In particular, vitamin C dosages of 500 mg daily have been reported to improve blood pressure, reduce blood triglycerides, increase HDL cholesterol (the good cholesterol), and lower BMI in several studies. Interestingly, giving fruit juice does not seem to be as effective as taking vitamin C supplements, which makes sense, as fruit juice is also rich in fructose. ([Location 1355](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B097XMY9VG&location=1355))
- Originally, these lifesaving mutations involving our uric acid and vitamin C levels did not make us fat. The fructose we ate mainly came from fruit and honey, which were available only seasonally, and obesity was rare. ([Location 1363](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B097XMY9VG&location=1363))
- When we are overweight or obese, it can put strain on our back, hardening the ligaments and tendons where they attach to the spine, fusing vertebrae, and causing an unusual bone formation. A classic site for this formation in people with obesity is along the spine’s right side. This unusual growth has a name: DISH, which stands for “diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis.” ([Location 1371](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B097XMY9VG&location=1371))
    - Tags: [[definition]] 
- While the wealthy could afford sugar, it remained much too costly for the average person for many years. In the fourteenth century, for example, one pound of sugar cost the equivalent of twenty-eight pounds of cheese or thirty-four dozen eggs. The economics of sugar changed, however, after sugarcane was introduced to the Americas. By the 1600s, England controlled much of the sugar coming from America, resulting in the infamous “triangle trade,” in which sugar was imported to England; the revenues from sugar sales were spent to manufacture gunpowder, lead, and salt, which were traded for slaves in Africa; and enslaved Africans were sent to the Americas to work the sugar and cotton plantations. ([Location 1407](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B097XMY9VG&location=1407))
- Not surprisingly, it was in these two countries, Holland and England, where obesity first began to rise. As early as 1685, the Dutch physician Steven Blankaart counseled that sugar had played a role in the rapid rise of dental cavities, obesity, and gout ([Location 1422](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B097XMY9VG&location=1422))
- Numerous studies have shown that the introduction of sugar into a community is almost inevitably followed by a rise in obesity and diabetes. This has been observed throughout the world, often in remote or isolated populations. ([Location 1466](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B097XMY9VG&location=1466))
- It is the disadvantaged—minority populations and the poor—that suffer the most from obesity and diabetes, as it is these groups that are, largely for economic reasons, consuming the most added sugars. The rates of obesity and diabetes are not intrinsically higher in the minority populations, but rather reflect the economics of sugar. ([Location 1491](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B097XMY9VG&location=1491))
#### CHAPTER 5 An Unpleasant Surprise: It’s Not Just Fructose
