### Introduction The Hyperactive Hive Mind
- What if email didn’t save knowledge work but instead accidentally traded minor conveniences for a major drag on real productivity ([Location 93](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BKSJX1M&location=93))
- The Hyperactive Hive Mind A workflow centered around ongoing conversation fueled by unstructured and unscheduled messages delivered through digital communication tools like email and instant messenger services. ([Location 138](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BKSJX1M&location=138))

- your day is now largely structured around tending your organization’s ongoing hive mind conversation. ([Location 142](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BKSJX1M&location=142))
- day is now largely structured around tending your organization’s ongoing hive mind conversation. ([Location 142](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BKSJX1M&location=142))
- To be fair, the hyperactive hive mind is not obviously a bad idea. Among the benefits of this workflow is the fact that it’s simple and incredibly adaptive. ([Location 145](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BKSJX1M&location=145))
- Beyond the very small scale (say, two or three people), this style of unstructured collaboration simply doesn’t mesh well with the way the human brain has evolved to operate. ([Location 151](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BKSJX1M&location=151))
- If your organization depends on the hive mind, then you cannot neglect your inbox or chat channels for long without slowing down the entire operation. ([Location 152](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BKSJX1M&location=152))
- As far as these social circuits are concerned, members of your tribe are trying to get your attention and you’re ignoring them: an event that registers as an emergency. The result of this constant state of unease is a low-grade background hum of anxiety that many inbox-bound knowledge workers have come to assume is unavoidable, but is actually an artifact of this unfortunate mismatch between our modern tools and ancient brains. ([Location 163](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BKSJX1M&location=163))
- Our belief that frenetic communication is somehow synonymous with work is largely a backfilled narrative we tell ourselves to make sense of sudden changes driven by complex dynamics. ([Location 168](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BKSJX1M&location=168))
- The world without email referenced in the title of this book, therefore, is not a place in which protocols like SMTP and POP3 are banished. It is, however, a place where you spend most of your day actually working on hard things instead of talking about this work, or endlessly bouncing small tasks back and forth in messages. ([Location 186](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BKSJX1M&location=186))
- Some care will therefore be needed in picking and choosing the strategies you implement. (I attempt to help you in this selection by highlighting examples of how the various principles have applied in the individual context.) ([Location 195](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BKSJX1M&location=195))
- The future of work is increasingly cognitive. This means that the sooner we take seriously how human brains actually function, and seek out strategies that best complement these realities, the sooner we’ll realize that the hyperactive hive mind, though convenient, is a disastrously ineffective way to organize our efforts. ([Location 200](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BKSJX1M&location=200))
### Chapter 1 Email Reduces Productivity
- Another common argument for email diminishing productivity centered on its ability to increase the amount of irrelevant information it suddenly forces you to process. ([Location 246](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BKSJX1M&location=246))
- It’s no longer accurate to think of communication tools as occasionally interrupting work; the more realistic model is one in which knowledge workers essentially partition their attention into two parallel tracks: one executing work tasks and the other managing an always-present, ongoing, and overloaded electronic conversation about these tasks. ([Location 365](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BKSJX1M&location=365))
- It’s important to emphasize that this parallel track approach to knowledge work, though perhaps shocking in its severity, is not obviously a bad thing. One could argue, for example, that this ongoing communication is efficient because it eliminates the overhead required to schedule formal meetings, and it allows people to receive exactly the information they need, exactly when they need it. ([Location 372](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BKSJX1M&location=372))
- One could also argue that the large number of different types of things we communicate about in a given day is also adaptive: a higher throughput approach to work that was made possible only by highly efficient messaging tools. ([Location 378](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BKSJX1M&location=378))
- As I’ll argue next, however, this optimism is flawed. The abstract value of the hyperactive hive mind workflow quickly dissipates when we’re forced to confront the concrete reality of how our ancient brains—evolved in a context far removed from electronic networks and low-friction messaging—actually function when asked to rapidly switch between many different targets of attention. ([Location 380](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BKSJX1M&location=380))
- From the perspective of a frenzied knowledge worker, a serious shortcoming of this process is that the prefrontal cortex can service only one attention target at a time. ([Location 390](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BKSJX1M&location=390))
- Not surprisingly, this network switching is not an instantaneous process; it requires both time and cognitive resources. ([Location 395](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BKSJX1M&location=395))
    - Tags: [[definition]] 
- network switching slows down the mind. ([Location 408](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BKSJX1M&location=408))
- Leroy surprised the subjects by having them complete a standard psychological exercise called a lexical decision task that was designed to quantify exactly how much the word puzzle remained on their mind—a measure she called attention residue. ([Location 423](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BKSJX1M&location=423))
    - Tags: [[definition]] 
- The only outlier was high time pressure and a completed task: under this combination, attention residue was reduced. As Leroy hypothesizes, when a task is confined to a well-defined block of time and fully completed during this block, it’s easier to move on, mentally speaking, when you’re done. ([Location 428](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BKSJX1M&location=428))
- the current context in which knowledge workers operate as a state of “divided attention,” in which the mind rarely gets closure before switching tasks, creating a muddle of competing activations and inhibitions that all add up to reduce our performance. ([Location 440](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BKSJX1M&location=440))
- Why is it so hard to do our work? Because our brains were never designed to maintain parallel tracks of attention. ([Location 442](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BKSJX1M&location=442))
- The implication of this final quip is that there’s a small group of professions that specifically value uninterrupted hard thinking—writers, programmers, scientists—but for most positions, being in the thick of things is a major part of the job. ([Location 457](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BKSJX1M&location=457))
- I’ve come to believe that this partition is too crude. For many different knowledge work positions—if not most—the ability to slow down, tackle things sequentially, and give each task uninterrupted attention is crucial, even if the role doesn’t regularly require hours of continuous deep thinking. ([Location 464](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BKSJX1M&location=464))
- Let’s shift our attention from managers to minders, the latter being my term for the many different roles that provide administrative or logistical support in knowledge work organizations. ([Location 537](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BKSJX1M&location=537))

### Chapter 2 Email Makes Us Miserable
- for those who score high in the common personality trait of neuroticism, batching emails actually makes you more stressed ([Location 677](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BKSJX1M&location=677))
- when stressed, people answer emails faster, but not better—a ([Location 679](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BKSJX1M&location=679))
- Perlow introduced a technique called predictable time off (PTO), in which team members were provided set times each week when they could completely disconnect from email and the phone (with the full support of their colleagues), ([Location 692](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BKSJX1M&location=692))

- social graph. The process here is straightforward. Imagine that you start with a large blank sheet of paper, pinned to a wall. You first draw a circle for every subject who wore a sensor, scattering them evenly across the page. Now, for every interaction event in your log, you draw a line between the circles that represents the two subjects interacting. If a line between them already exists, you can thicken it slightly. When you’re done processing all the interactions, you’re left with a spaghetti pile mess of lines of varying thickness connecting the circles on the paper. Some circles, like busy transit hubs, emanate thick lines in all directions, while others are only sparsely connected; some collections of circles may have very few lines between them, while others are deeply interconnected. ([Location 758](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BKSJX1M&location=758))

- your company might even have crystal clear norms about how long it is acceptable to wait before responding to email, ([Location 802](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BKSJX1M&location=802))
    - Note: I should write my com expectations in my manager doc, including when not to check messages
- To your entrenched social circuitry, evolved over millennia of food shortages mitigated through strategic alliances, these unanswered messages become the psychological equivalent of ignoring a tribe member who might later prove key to surviving the next drought. From this perspective, the crowded email inbox is not just frustrating—it’s a matter of life or death. ([Location 806](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BKSJX1M&location=806))
- No matter what the expectations, the awareness that there are messages waiting for you somewhere triggers anxiety, ruining the potential relaxation of your time off. The only cure is to prevent the messages from arriving altogether. ([Location 834](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BKSJX1M&location=834))
- As long as we remain committed to a workflow based on constant, ad hoc messaging, our Paleolithic brain will remain in a state of low-grade anxiety. ([Location 840](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BKSJX1M&location=840))
- When preparing to migrate, the baboons in the troop carefully watch one another’s movements, looking in particular for initiators who begin to head away from the group in some fixed direction. How they respond to these initiators depends a lot on how they’re arranged in space. If the angle between two initiators is more than ninety degrees, meaning they are leaving the group in quite different directions, then the remaining baboons will commit their loyalty to one, reinforcing that proposal. On the other hand, if two initiators head off in similar directions, the remaining baboons will tend to compromise by committing to a direction that’s somewhere in between. If too many initiators are active at the same time, the remaining baboons are more likely to stay where they are, slowing down the decision-making process until the options converge. Once a given initiator attracts enough followers, the whole troop will follow. ([Location 854](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BKSJX1M&location=854))
- One such signal delivered through this unconscious network is called, aptly enough, influence. It describes the degree to which one person can cause another to match their speaking pattern. This information, which is processed in our brain through subcortical structures centered on the tectum, provides a fast and accurate snapshot of power dynamics in a given room. ([Location 890](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BKSJX1M&location=890))
    - Tags: [[definition]] 
- Another such signal is activity, which describes a person’s physical movements during a conversation. Shifting in your seat, leaning forward, demonstrative gesticulating—these behaviors, which are mediated largely through the autonomic nervous system (“an extremely old neural structure”), provide a surprisingly accurate reading of the true intentions of an individual in the interaction.27 ([Location 892](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BKSJX1M&location=892))

- How much does this person believe in this idea? How confident are they when speaking? How determined are they to make it work?” ([Location 902](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BKSJX1M&location=902))
- When we shifted toward the hyperactive hive mind workflow in the 1990s and early 2000s, we believed we were just taking the conversations that were happening in conference rooms and on phone lines and shifting them onto a new messaging medium, leaving the content of these interactions largely unchanged. As research like Alex Pentland’s emphasizes, however, this prioritization of abstract written communication over in-person communication disregarded the immensely complex and finely tuned social circuits that our species evolved to optimize our ability to work cooperatively. By embracing email, we inadvertently crippled the systems that make us so good at working together. ([Location 905](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BKSJX1M&location=905))
- The conclusion of this work is that emails are commonly misunderstood because of the “inherent difficulty of moving beyond one’s subjective experience of a stimulus and imagining how the stimulus might be evaluated by someone who does not share one’s privileged perspective.” To make matters even worse, the researchers found that the recipients of these ambiguous messages were as overconfident as the senders. They were confident that they were correctly detecting sarcasm or identifying humor, even when they weren’t doing well at all. This last observation applies a particularly devious twist to our understanding of email’s many confusions. It’s not just that we’re less clear than we think, but we’re often completely misunderstood. ([Location 949](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BKSJX1M&location=949))
- When the scientist’s email was temporarily removed, the boss stopped handing off the extra requests, even though his office was only two doors down from the scientist’s laboratory. Simply adding a small amount of friction significantly reduced the requests coming the scientist’s way. For many knowledge workers, this story probably makes sense—how many of the quick asks for someone else’s time and attention that you dash off over email during a normal day would you still make if you had to instead walk down the hallway and interrupt someone’s work? ([Location 1022](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BKSJX1M&location=1022))
    - Tags: [[definition]] 
- If slightly increasing friction drastically reduces the requests made on your time and attention, then most of these requests are not vital to your organization’s operation in the first place; they are instead a side effect of the artificially low resistance created by digital communication tools. ([Location 1028](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BKSJX1M&location=1028))
- The idea that eliminating friction can cause problems might sound unusual, as we’re used to thinking about more efficiency producing more effectiveness, but among engineers like me, this concept is commonly understood. Too little friction can lead to feedback loops that spiral out of control, ([Location 1030](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BKSJX1M&location=1030))
    - Tags: [[favorite]] 
- When the friction involved in asking someone to do something was removed, the number of these requests spiraled out of control. I frantically try to grab other people’s time and attention to make up for the time and attention they’ve already grabbed from me. ([Location 1033](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BKSJX1M&location=1033))
- Friction also motivates the development of more intelligent processes. Imagine that I frequently need you to sign a certain type of requisition form. With low-friction communication tools like email, I might simply shoot you copies of the forms to sign whenever I need them, as this gets the responsibility off my plate with minimal effort. Without email, however, the pain of having to come physically find you for every signature will motivate me to develop a better system, such as one where I put these forms in your mailbox on Friday morning and you promise to sign them and have them back to me by Monday morning. This system is much better for you, as it frees you from yet another source of unscheduled requests for your time and attention, but it was unlikely to emerge in a setting where just firing off the forms electronically generated essentially zero cost. ([Location 1042](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BKSJX1M&location=1042))
- three specific ways in which the hyperactive hive mind workflow makes us unhappy: the __psychological anxiety of an inbox that fills up faster than we can empty it__, the __frustrating ineffectiveness of text-only communication__, and the __out-of-control overload that results when friction is eliminated from office interactions__. ([Location 1060](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BKSJX1M&location=1060))
### Chapter 3 Email Has a Mind of Its Own
- But the telephone was no panacea. It represents an example of what communication specialists call synchronous messaging, which requires all parties in the interaction to participate at the same time. ([Location 1085](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BKSJX1M&location=1085))
    - Tags: [[definition]] 
- asynchronous messaging, which doesn’t require a receiver to be present when a message is sent. ([Location 1092](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BKSJX1M&location=1092))
    - Tags: [[definition]] 
- What the rise of the large office really needed—a productivity silver bullet of sorts—was some way to combine the speed of synchronous communication with the low overhead of asynchronous communication. ([Location 1098](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BKSJX1M&location=1098))
- A closer examination revealed that not only did people send many more messages than they did in the pre-email era; they also began cc’ing these messages to many more people. “Pre-email, simple communication was largely person-to-person,” Stone told me. After email, these same conversations now unfolded over long back-and-forth threads including many different people. “Thus—in a mere week or so—was gained and blown the potential productivity gain of email,” he joked. ([Location 1179](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BKSJX1M&location=1179))
- Before the stirrup, a warrior on a horse had to wield his spear or sword with “the strength of shoulder and biceps.”15 The stirrup enabled a “vastly more effective mode of attack.” By bracing a lance between his upper arm and body, a rider leaning forward in metal stirrups could deliver a blow with the combined force of his weight and the weight of his stallion. The difference between these two attacks was monumental. ([Location 1219](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BKSJX1M&location=1219))
- In a medieval version of the nuclear arms race that would follow more than a millennium later, Charles Martel realized that the advantage provided by the stirrup was so “immense” that he had to do whatever it took to get it before his enemies did—even if that meant upending centuries of tradition and creating a brand-new form of government. ([Location 1223](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BKSJX1M&location=1223))
- Over time, this idea that tools can sometimes drive human behavior became known as technological determinism. ([Location 1228](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BKSJX1M&location=1228))
    - Tags: [[definition]] 
- Gutenberg, in other words, thought he was setting information free, but in reality, he was changing fundamentally what information we treated as important. ([Location 1240](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BKSJX1M&location=1240))
- A more modern example of technological determinism is the introduction of the Like button to Facebook. ... the original purpose of this feature was to clean up the comments below users’ posts. Facebook engineers noticed that many such comments were simple positive exclamations, like “cool” or “nice.” They figured that if those could instead be captured by clicking Like, the comments that remained would be more substantive. ... As became clear in retrospect, incoming Likes provide users with an uneven stream of social approval indicators—bits ... Soon every other major platform introduced similar approval indicator streams—favorites, retweets, auto-tagging photos, streaks—as part of a technological contest played out on the field of what became known as attention engineering, a battle that left in its wake a small number of massively powerful technology platform monopolies and a weary populace exhausted by a life increasingly dominated by handheld glowing screens. ([Location 1241](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BKSJX1M&location=1241))
- A key property of technological determinism is that the innovation in question alters our behavior in ways that were neither intended nor predicted by those first adopting the tool. ([Location 1256](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BKSJX1M&location=1256))
- determinist analysis, which in recent years has fallen out of fashion in academic circles currently more enamored with theories that understand tools as vectors of social power. ([Location 1259](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BKSJX1M&location=1259))
- New tools open up some new options for behavior while closing off others. When these changes then interact with our inscrutable human brains and the complex social systems in which we operate, the results can be both significant and unpredictable. The technologies in question in these studies are not literally deciding how humans should behave, but their effects can be so surprising and sudden to those involved that a story line of tools determining behavior seems as valid as any for describing what’s going on. (The technology scholar Doug Hill uses the term de facto autonomy to describe this effect.) ([Location 1263](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BKSJX1M&location=1263))
    - Tags: [[definition]] 
- We chose to use email because it was a rational solution to the need for practical asynchronous communication in large offices. The hyperactive hive mind, in some sense, subsequently chose us once this tool had spread, at which point we seemed to have all looked up from our newly empowered inboxes, shrugged, and quipped: “I guess this is how we work now.” ([Location 1277](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BKSJX1M&location=1277))
- The quick phone call, it turns out, cannot always be replaced with a single quick message, but instead often requires dozens of ambiguous digital notes passed back and forth to replicate the interactive nature of conversation. ([Location 1296](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BKSJX1M&location=1296))
- A striking computer science discovery from this period, for example, is the difficulty of the so-called consensus problem. Imagine that each machine in a distributed system starts an operation, such as entering a transaction into a database, with an initial preference to either proceed or abort. The goal is for these machines to reach a consensus—either all agreeing to proceed or all agreeing to abort. ([Location 1312](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BKSJX1M&location=1312))
    - Tags: [[definition]] 
- asynchronous communication complicates attempts to coordinate, and therefore, it’s almost always worth the extra cost required to introduce more synchrony. ([Location 1329](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BKSJX1M&location=1329))
- Synchrony might be expensive to arrange—both in the office setting and in computer systems—but trying to coordinate in its absence is also expensive. ([Location 1348](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BKSJX1M&location=1348))
- asynchrony is not just synchrony spread out; it instead introduces its own difficulties. ([Location 1352](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BKSJX1M&location=1352))
- Perhaps it’s 2010, you’ve just started using a smartphone, and you realize it’s now possible to answer client questions that arrive after work hours or respond quickly to colleagues in different time zones. These clients and colleagues now learn that you’re available at these new times and begin to send more requests and expect faster responses. Faced with this increased influx, you check your phone more often so you can keep up with the incoming messages. But now the expectations for your availability and responsiveness increase further, and you feel pressured to respond even quicker. ([Location 1366](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BKSJX1M&location=1366))
- She further proposed an email server configured such that messages sent after work hours would be automatically held and delivered the next morning (a special flag could be set to bypass this restriction for actual urgent communication). ([Location 1378](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BKSJX1M&location=1378))
- Douglas Rushkoff uses the term “collaborative pacing” to describe this tendency for groups of humans to converge toward strict patterns of behavior without ever actually explicitly deciding that the new behaviors make sense.

- increasing the size of a team doesn’t necessarily increase its effectiveness in direct proportion. ([Location 1422](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BKSJX1M&location=1422))
- Though there’s no specific team size that consistently emerges as optimal, essentially every result falls into a narrow range of roughly four to twelve people—exactly as we observed all the way back with the Paleolithic elephant hunters. ([Location 1425](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BKSJX1M&location=1425))
- The loafing effect first observed by Ringelmann, for example, seems to still play a role in knowledge work tasks.

- Drucker is more than just a famous business theorist. His influence also helps answer a pressing question that likely snagged your attention as you read this chapter: Even if we accept that the hyperactive hive mind arose largely of its own accord, why did we let it stick around once its flaws became obvious? ([Location 1457](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BKSJX1M&location=1457))
- With the exception of some routinized bureaucratic processes, like filing expense reports, the intricacies of how the myriad demanding tasks that define modern office work are accomplished remain largely beyond the scope of management. They’re pushed instead into the hazy realm of personal productivity. Want to know how to get things done? Buy a book on how to better organize your tasks (Drucker himself wrote one of the first such books, The Effective Executive), or use a new planner, or, as is more commonly suggested in our culture of “crushing it,” simply work harder. Knowledge workers don’t expect their organization to take an interest in how much work falls on their plate, or how they get it done. ([Location 1479](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BKSJX1M&location=1479))
- It’s in this context that the hyperactive hive mind, once in place, became devilishly difficult to eradicate, as it’s hard to fix a broken workflow when it’s no one’s job to make sure the workflow functions.
