## Highlights
### CHAPTER 1 The Bounds of Reality
- Parallel worlds or parallel universes or multiple universes or alternate universes or the metaverse, megaverse, or multiverse—they’re all synonymous and they’re all among the words used to embrace not just our universe but a spectrum of others that may be out there. ([Location 99](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004C43ETO&location=99))
- many of the major developments in fundamental theoretical physics—relativistic physics, quantum physics, cosmological physics, unified physics, computational physics—have led us to consider one or another variety of parallel universe. ([Location 111](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004C43ETO&location=111))
- the predictions of science are necessarily probabilistic. We can predict the odds of attaining one outcome, we can predict the odds of another, but we generally can’t predict which will actually happen. ([Location 121](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004C43ETO&location=121))
- After decades of closely studying quantum mechanics, and after having accumulated a wealth of data confirming its probabilistic predictions, no one has been able to explain why only one of the many possible outcomes in any given situation actually happens. ([Location 123](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004C43ETO&location=123))
- The mathematics underlying quantum mechanics—or at least, one perspective on the math—suggests that all possible outcomes happen, each inhabiting its own separate universe. ([Location 129](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004C43ETO&location=129))
- quantum mechanics is only one of numerous ways that a conception of parallel universes emerges from modern physics. ([Location 144](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004C43ETO&location=144))

    - Tags: [[definition]] 
- branes might collide, bounce apart, attract each other gravitationally, and then collide again, a cyclic process generating universes that are parallel not in space but in time. ([Location 162](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004C43ETO&location=162))
- It’s not that physicists are standing ready, multiverse nets in their hands, seeking to snare any passing theory that might be slotted, however awkwardly, into a parallel-universe paradigm. Rather, all of the parallel-universe proposals that we will take seriously emerge unbidden from the mathematics of theories developed to explain conventional data and observations.
