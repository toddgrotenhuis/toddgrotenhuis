## Highlights
- Fate is the hand of cards we’ve been dealt. Choice is how we play the hand. ([Location 282](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PEN0Y&location=282))
- we feel regret’s sharp sting when we reflect on the opportunities squandered, the choices deferred, the efforts not made, the talents never developed in our lives. ([Location 295](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PEN0Y&location=295))
- Regret is the emotion we experience when we assess our present circumstances and reconsider how we got here. ([Location 314](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PEN0Y&location=314))
- (the only thing worse than experiencing pain is not knowing if and when the pain will go away). ([Location 320](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PEN0Y&location=320))
    - Note: omg yes
- The pain that comes with regret should be mandatory, not something to be shooed away like an annoying pet. When we make bad choices and fail ourselves or hurt the people we love, we should feel pain. That pain can be motivating and in the best sense, triggering—a reminder that maybe we messed up but we can do better. It’s one of the most powerful feelings guiding us to change. ([Location 322](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PEN0Y&location=322))
- It’s hard to initiate behavioral change, even harder to stay the course, hardest of all to make the change stick. ([Location 346](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PEN0Y&location=346))
- I’d go so far as to say that adult behavioral change is the most difficult thing for sentient human beings to accomplish. ([Location 347](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PEN0Y&location=347))
- It takes extraordinary effort to stop doing something in our comfort zone (because it’s painless or familiar or mildly pleasurable) in order to start something difficult that will be good for us in the long run. ([Location 363](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PEN0Y&location=363))
- There’s a difference between motivation and understanding and ability. ([Location 367](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PEN0Y&location=367))
- a keen appreciation of our environment can dramatically lift not only our motivation, ability, and understanding of the change process, but also our confidence that we can actually do it. ([Location 370](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PEN0Y&location=370))
- It’s about changing your behavior when you’re among people you respect and love. They are your target audience. ([Location 433](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PEN0Y&location=433))
- do not be lulled into dismissiveness because my advice sounds simple. Achieving meaningful and lasting change may be simple—simpler than we imagine. But simple is far from easy. ([Location 437](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PEN0Y&location=437))
- My mission is to help people become the person that they want to be, not tell them who that person is.) ([Location 454](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PEN0Y&location=454))
- We fall back on a set of beliefs that trigger denial, resistance, and ultimately self-delusion. ([Location 466](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PEN0Y&location=466))
- An excuse explains why we fell short of expectations after the fact. Our inner beliefs trigger failure before it happens. ([Location 472](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PEN0Y&location=472))
- My suggestions will help you understand how to close the gap between the “ideal you” and the “real you.” ([Location 476](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PEN0Y&location=476))
- there’s a difference between understanding and doing. ([Location 482](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PEN0Y&location=482))
- Our environment is a magnificent willpower-reduction machine. ([Location 489](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PEN0Y&location=489))
- the willpower we assume when we set a goal rarely measures up to the willpower we display in achieving that goal. ([Location 495](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PEN0Y&location=495))
- When we presume that we are better than people who need structure and guidance, we lack one of the most crucial ingredients for change: humility. ([Location 517](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PEN0Y&location=517))
- We seldom recognize that self-control is a limited resource. ([Location 522](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PEN0Y&location=522))
- If we don’t follow up, our positive change doesn’t last. ([Location 560](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PEN0Y&location=560))
- Even when we get there, we cannot stay there without commitment and discipline. ([Location 562](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PEN0Y&location=562))
- Getting better is its own reward. ([Location 582](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PEN0Y&location=582))
- While our slow and steady improvement may not be as obvious to others as it is to us, when we revert to our previous behavior, people always notice. ([Location 586](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PEN0Y&location=586))
- We can change not only our behavior but how we define ourselves. ([Location 593](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PEN0Y&location=593))
- We are notoriously inaccurate in assessing ourselves. ([Location 596](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PEN0Y&location=596))
- In an environment of entitlement, we behave accordingly. ([Location 619](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PEN0Y&location=619))
- We think we control our environment but in fact it controls us. ([Location 632](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PEN0Y&location=632))
    - Note: There’s likely a loop here…
- Our environment is a nonstop triggering mechanism whose impact on our behavior is too significant to be ignored. ([Location 638](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PEN0Y&location=638))
- Sometimes altering one factor can turn an ideal environment into a disaster. ([Location 657](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PEN0Y&location=657))
- Karl’s defense was, “I never asked my people to do anything immoral or illegal.” He didn’t need to ask. The environment he created did the work for him. ([Location 672](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PEN0Y&location=672))
- Some environments are designed precisely to lure us into acting against our interest. ([Location 698](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PEN0Y&location=698))
- Very smart people have spent their waking hours with one goal in mind: designing each detail so it triggers a customer to stay and spend. ([Location 705](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PEN0Y&location=705))
- We put off going to bed at the intended time because we prefer to remain in our current environment— ([Location 718](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PEN0Y&location=718))
- It’s a simple dynamic: a changing environment changes us. ([Location 735](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PEN0Y&location=735))
- If we do not create and control our environment, our environment creates and controls us. ([Location 787](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PEN0Y&location=787))
- Feedback—both the act of giving it and taking it—is our first step in becoming smarter, more mindful about the connection between our environment and our behavior. ([Location 808](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PEN0Y&location=808))
- Feedback teaches us to see our environment as a triggering mechanism. In some cases, the feedback itself is the trigger. ([Location 809](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PEN0Y&location=809))
- A feedback loop comprises four stages: evidence, relevance, consequence, and action. ([Location 832](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PEN0Y&location=832))
- What if we could control our environment so it triggered our most desired behavior—like an elegantly designed feedback loop? ([Location 860](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PEN0Y&location=860))
- A behavioral trigger is any stimulus that impacts our behavior. ([Location 864](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PEN0Y&location=864))
- Direct triggers are stimuli that immediately and obviously impact behavior, with no intermediate steps between the triggering event and your response. ([Location 867](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PEN0Y&location=867))
- Indirect triggers take a more circuitous route before influencing behavior. ([Location 869](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PEN0Y&location=869))
- External triggers come from the environment, bombarding our five senses as well as our minds. ([Location 872](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PEN0Y&location=872))
- Internal triggers come from thoughts or feelings that are not connected with any outside stimulus. ([Location 873](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PEN0Y&location=873))
- Conscious triggers require awareness. ([Location 877](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PEN0Y&location=877))
- Unconscious triggers shape your behavior beyond your awareness. ([Location 878](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PEN0Y&location=878))
- We see anticipated triggers coming a mile away. ([Location 884](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PEN0Y&location=884))
- Unanticipated triggers take us by surprise, and as a result stimulate unfamiliar behavior. ([Location 886](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PEN0Y&location=886))
- Encouraging triggers push us to maintain or expand what we are doing. They are reinforcing. ([Location 889](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PEN0Y&location=889))
- Discouraging triggers push us to stop or reduce what we are doing. ([Location 890](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PEN0Y&location=890))
- Productive triggers push us toward becoming the person we want to be. ([Location 894](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PEN0Y&location=894))
- Counterproductive triggers pull us away. ([Location 895](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PEN0Y&location=895))
- We want short-term gratification while we need long-term benefit. And we never get a break from choosing one or the other. It’s the defining conflict of adult behavioral change. ([Location 901](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PEN0Y&location=901))
- If only our encouraging triggers and productive triggers were the same. ([Location 908](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PEN0Y&location=908))
- Pick a behavioral goal you’re still pursuing. ([Location 947](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PEN0Y&location=947))
- List the people and situations that influence the quality of your performance. ([Location 948](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PEN0Y&location=948))
- Then chart the triggers to see if you’re on the right side. ([Location 951](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PEN0Y&location=951))
- You’re getting too much of what you want, not enough of what you need. ([Location 952](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PEN0Y&location=952))

- it’s up to me to escape the upper left quadrant where I prefer what I want to what I need. ([Location 970](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PEN0Y&location=970))
- The habit loop makes it sound as if all we need is an awareness of our cues so we can automatically respond with an appropriate behavior. That’s fine with habits. But when we’re changing interpersonal behavior, we’re adding a layer of complexity in the form of other people. Our triggered response can’t always be automatic and unthinking and habitual—because as caring human beings we have to consider how people will respond to our actions. ([Location 1012](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PEN0Y&location=1012))
- I’ve isolated three eye-blink moments—first the impulse, then the awareness, then a choice—that comprise the crucial intervals between the trigger and our eventual behavior. ([Location 1025](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PEN0Y&location=1025))
    - Tags: [[favorite]] 
- We can make any impulse run in place for a brief moment while we choose to obey or ignore it. ([Location 1033](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PEN0Y&location=1033))
- The more aware we are, the less likely any trigger, even in the most mundane circumstances, will prompt hasty unthinking behavior that leads to undesirable consequences. ([Location 1049](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PEN0Y&location=1049))
- These tiny annoyances should trigger bemusement over life’s rich tapestry instead of turning us into umbrage-taking characters from a Seinfeld episode. ([Location 1066](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PEN0Y&location=1066))
- The most effective leaders can vary their leadership style to fit the needs of the situation. Hence, the term situational leadership. ([Location 1094](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PEN0Y&location=1094))
- There’s the leader/planner/manager who plans to change his or her ways. And there’s the follower/doer/employee who must execute the plan. We think they are the same because we unwittingly function as one or the other throughout our day. They are both part of who we are. But we are wrong. ([Location 1127](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PEN0Y&location=1127))
- we start each day as a bifurcated individual, one part leader, the other part follower—and as the day progresses, the two grow further apart. ([Location 1130](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PEN0Y&location=1130))
- the precepts of situational leadership might be useful in the context of self-managed adult behavioral change. ([Location 1149](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PEN0Y&location=1149))
- measure the need, choose the style. ([Location 1151](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PEN0Y&location=1151))
- how we manage others is how we should manage ourselves— ([Location 1165](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PEN0Y&location=1165))
- We are superior planners and inferior doers. ([Location 1188](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PEN0Y&location=1188))
- Forecasting is what we must do after acknowledging the environment’s power over us. It comprises three interconnected stages: anticipation, avoidance, and adjustment. ([Location 1246](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PEN0Y&location=1246))
- The problem is that the majority of our day consists of minor moments, when we’re not thinking about the environment or our behavior because we don’t associate the situation with any consequences. ([Location 1262](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PEN0Y&location=1262))
- We’re generally shrewd about avoiding environments that present a physical or emotional risk or are otherwise unpleasant. ([Location 1292](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PEN0Y&location=1292))
- On the other hand, we rarely triumph over an environment that is enjoyable. ([Location 1293](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PEN0Y&location=1293))
- It takes enormous willpower to stop doing something enjoyable. ([Location 1295](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PEN0Y&location=1295))
    - Note: But less to not start it!
- succumbing to the temptation to exercise power when they would be better off showing restraint. ([Location 1306](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PEN0Y&location=1306))
- When they refuse to answer a no-win question at a press conference, they’re practicing avoidance. ([Location 1334](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PEN0Y&location=1334))
- To avoid undesirable behavior, avoid the environments where it is most likely to occur. ([Location 1337](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PEN0Y&location=1337))
- a simple question can trigger a simple response that’s appropriate in one environment and completely wrong in another. ([Location 1363](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PEN0Y&location=1363))
- there is no harder task for adults than changing our behavior. ([Location 1382](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PEN0Y&location=1382))
- We’re often too distracted to hear what the environment is telling us. But in those moments when we’re dialed in and paying attention, the seemingly covert triggers that shape our behavior become apparent. ([Location 1388](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PEN0Y&location=1388))
- we have a bifurcated response to the environment in which we display two discrete personas I call “planner” and “doer.” ([Location 1393](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PEN0Y&location=1393))
    - Tags: [[definition]] 
- To understand a problem, you not only have to admit there is a problem; you also have to appreciate all your options. ([Location 1399](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PEN0Y&location=1399))
- Are we creating ourselves, or wasting the opportunity and being created by external forces instead? ([Location 1417](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PEN0Y&location=1417))
- just satisfied—we yield to inertia. We continue doing what we’ve always done. If we’re dissatisfied, we may go to the other extreme, falling for any and every idea, never pursuing one idea long enough so that it takes root and actually shapes a recognizably new us. ([Location 1431](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PEN0Y&location=1431))
- creating spans a continuum from adding to inventing. ([Location 1435](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PEN0Y&location=1435))
- Preserving sounds passive and mundane, but it’s a real choice. It requires soul-searching to figure out what serves us well, and discipline to refrain from abandoning it for something new and shiny and not necessarily better. ([Location 1441](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PEN0Y&location=1441))
- Successful people, by definition, are doing a lot of things correctly, so they have a lot to preserve. But they also have a baseline urge that equates steady advancement with constant improvement. They’re geared to fight the status quo, not maintain it. When they face the choice of being good or getting even better, they instinctively opt for the latter—and risk losing some desirable qualities. ([Location 1443](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PEN0Y&location=1443))
- “The most thankless decision I make is the one that prevents something bad from happening, because I can never prove that I prevented something even worse.” ([Location 1456](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PEN0Y&location=1456))
- We rarely get credit for not messing up a good thing. It’s a tactic that looks brilliant only in hindsight—and only to the individual doing the preserving. ([Location 1457](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PEN0Y&location=1457))

- Businesspeople, reluctant to admit any defeat, can’t help equating “acceptance” with “acquiescence.” ([Location 1486](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PEN0Y&location=1486))
- our natural impulse is to think wishfully (that is, favor the optimal, discount the negative) rather than realistically. That impulse is even more egregious in interpersonal relationships. ([Location 1497](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PEN0Y&location=1497))

- When we bluntly challenge ourselves to figure out what we can change and what we can’t, what to lose and what to keep, we often surprise ourselves with the bold simplicity of our answers. ([Location 1543](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PEN0Y&location=1543))

- the reasons are attributed to external factors ([Location 1613](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PEN0Y&location=1613))
- When asked exclusively, passive questions can be the natural enemy of taking personal responsibility and demonstrating accountability. ([Location 1622](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PEN0Y&location=1622))
- People don’t get better without follow-up. ([Location 1691](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PEN0Y&location=1691))
- The theory was that different phrasing of the follow-up questions would have a measurable effect because active questions focus respondents on what they can do to make a positive difference in the world rather than what the world can do to make a positive difference for them.

- Active questions were twice as effective at delivering training’s desired benefits to employees. While any follow-up was shown to be superior to no follow-up, a simple tweak in the language of follow-up—focusing on what the individual can control—makes a significant difference.

- One of the unappreciated benefits of Daily Questions is that they force us to quantify an unfamiliar data point: our level of trying. We rarely do that. We treat effort as a second-class citizen. It’s the condolence message we send ourselves when we fail. We say, “I gave it my best shot,” or “I get an A for effort.” But after a few days, quantifying effort rather than outcome reveals patterns that we’d otherwise miss.

- Depletion isn’t limited to self-control. It applies to many forms of self-regulated behavior. Most obviously it affects our decision making. ([Location 2633](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PEN0Y&location=2633))
- Researchers call this decision fatigue, a state that leaves us with two courses of action: 1) we make careless choices or 2) we surrender to the status quo and do nothing. ([Location 2636](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PEN0Y&location=2636))
- It’s also why we put off decisions; we’re too drained to decide now. ([Location 2639](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PEN0Y&location=2639))
- Dealing all day with difficult, high-maintenance colleagues is depleting. Maintaining a compliant façade around a leader you don’t respect is depleting. Excessive multitasking is depleting. Trying to persuade people to agree with you when they are inclined to oppose you is depleting. So is trying to make people like you when they are predisposed to dislike you. Suppressing your opinions—or for that matter, engaging in any effort to control your emotions around others—is depleting. ([Location 2650](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PEN0Y&location=2650))
- Unlike being physically tired, however, we’re usually unaware of depletion. ([Location 2653](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PEN0Y&location=2653))
- Under depletion’s influence we are more prone to inappropriate social interactions, such as talking too much, sharing intimate personal information, and being arrogant. We are less likely to follow social norms; for example, we are more likely to cheat. We are less helpful. We can also be more aggressive; the effort of curbing our normal aggression depletes our self-control over that impulse. Conversely, we can also be more passive; when our intellectual resources are sapped, we are more easily persuaded by others and less adept at coming up with counterarguments. ([Location 2660](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PEN0Y&location=2660))
- Basically, all the natural urges we try to rein in during the day have the potential to rush toward center stage as the day progresses and our depletion increases. ([Location 2664](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PEN0Y&location=2664))
