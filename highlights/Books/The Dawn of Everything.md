## Highlights
### 1: Farewell to Humanity's Childhood Or, why this is not a book about the origins of inequality
- One thing that will quickly become clear is that the prevalent 'big picture' of history—shared by modern-day followers of Hobbes and Rousseau alike—has almost nothing to do with the facts. (Page 4)
#### WHY BOTH THE HOBBESIAN AND ROUSSEAUIAN VERSIONS OF HUMAN HISTORY HAVE DIRE POLITICAL IMPLICATIONS
- The political implications of the Hobbesian model need little elaboration. It is a foundational assumption of our economic system that humans are at base somewhat nasty and selfish creatures, basing their decisions on cynical, egoistic calculation rather than altruism or cooperation; in which case, the best we can hope for are more sophisticated internal and external controls on our supposedly innate drive towards accumulation and self-aggrandizement. (Page 6)
- Rousseau's story about how humankind descended into inequality from an original state of egalitarian innocence seems more optimistic (at least there was somewhere better to fall from), but nowadays it's mostly deployed to convince us that while the system we live under might be unjust, the most we can realistically aim for is a bit of modest tinkering. The term 'inequality' is itself very telling in this regard. (Page 6)
- After all, imagine we framed the problem differently, the way it might have been fifty or 100 years ago: as the concentration of capital, or oligopoly, or class power. Compared to any of these, a word like 'inequality' sounds like it's practically designed to encourage halfmeasures and compromise. It's possible to imagine overthrowing capitalism or breaking the power of the state, but it's not clear what eliminating inequality would even mean. (Which kind of inequality? Wealth? Opportunity? Exactly how equal would people have to be in order for us to be able to say we've 'eliminated inequality'?) The term 'inequality' is a way of framing social problems appropriate to an age of technocratic reformers, who assume from the outset that no real vision of social transformation is even on the table.
  Debating inequality allows one to tinker with the numbers, argue about Gini coefficients and thresholds of dysfunction, readjust tax regimes or social welfare mechanisms, even shock the public with figures showing just how bad things have become ('Can you imagine? The richest I per cent of the world's population own 44 per cent of the world's wealth!') - but it also allows one to do all this without addressing any of the factors that people actually object to about such 'unequal' social arrangements: for instance, that __some manage to turn their wealth into power over others__; or that other __people end up being told their needs are not important__, and __their lives have no intrinsic worth__. (Page 6)
- Otherwise, the best can hope for is to adjust the size of the boot that will forever stomping on our faces; or, perhaps, to wrangle a bit more wiggle room in which some of us can temporarily duck out of its way. (Page 8)
    - Note: Speaking facetiously
- The ultimate question of human history, as we'll see, is not our __equal access to material resources__ (land, calories, means of production), much though these things are obviously important, but our __equal capacity to contribute to decisions about how to live together__. Of course, to exercise that capacity implies that there should be something meaningful to decide in the first place. (Page 8)
- If, as many are suggesting, our species' future now hinges on our capacity to create something different (say, a system in which __wealth cannot be freely transformed into power__, or __where some people are not told their needs are unimportant__, or __that their lives have no intrinsic worth__), then what ultimately matters is whether we can rediscover the freedoms that make us human in the first place. (Page 8)
#### SOME BRIEF EXAMPLES OF WHY RECEIVED UNDERSTANDINGS OF THE BROAD SWEEP OF HUMAN HISTORY ARE MOSTLY WRONG (OR, THE ETERNAL RETURN OF JEAN-JACQUES ROUSSEAU)
- …there is simply no reason to believe that small-scale groups are especially likely to be or, conversely, that large ones must necessarily have kings, presidents or even bureaucracies. Statements like these are just so many prejudices dressed up as facts, or even as laws of history. (Page 11)
#### ON THE PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS
- …Rousseau himself never suggested that the innocent State of Nature really happened. On the contrary, he insisted he was engaging in a thought experiment… (Page 11)
- His imaginary State of Nature was primarily invoked as a way of illustrating the point. True, he didn't invent the concept: as a rhetorical device, the State of Nature had already been used in European philosophy for a century. Widely deployed by natural law theorists, it effectively allowed every thinker interested in the origins of government (Locke, Grotius and so on) to play God, each coming up with his own variant on humanity's original condition, as a springboard for speculation. (Page 12)
- …during the Palaeolithic, only rather unusual individuals were buried at all. (Page 15)
- As we get to grips with the actual evidence, we always find that the realities of early human social life were far more complex, and a good deal more interesting, than any modernday State of Nature theorist would ever be likely to guess. (Page 15)
- When it comes to cherry-picking anthropological case studies, and putting them forward as representative of our 'contemporary ancestors'—that is, as models for what humans might have been like in a State of Nature—those working in the tradition of Rousseau tend to prefer African foragers like the Hadza, Pygmies or !Kung. Those who follow Hobbes prefer the Yanomami. (Page 15)
- For obvious reasons, Hobbes's position tends to be favoured by those on the right of the political spectrum, and Rousseau's by those leaning left. (Page 15)
- The idea that our current ideals of freedom, equality and democracy are somehow products of the Western tradition' would in fact have come as an enormous surprise to someone like Voltaire, As we'll soon see, the Enlightenment thinkers who propounded such ideals almost invariably put them in the mouths of foreigners, even 'savages' like the Yanomami. This is hardly surprising, since it's almost impossible to find a single author in that Western tradition, from Plato to Marcus Aurelius to Erasmus, who did not make it clear that they would have been opposed to such ideas. The word 'democracy' might have been invented in Europe (barely, since Greece at the time was much closer culturally to North Africa and the Middle East than it was to, say, England), but __it's almost impossible to find a single European author before the nineteenth century who suggested it would be anything other than a terrible form of government__. (Page 17)
- About the only dependable way anyone has ever discovered to determine whether one way of living is really more satisfying, fulfilling, happy or otherwise preferable to any other is to allow people to fully experience both, give them a choice, then watch what they actually do. (Page 18)
- But empirical data *is* available here, and it suggests something is very wrong with Pinker's conclusions. (Page 18)
- Her story is by no means unusual. The colonial history of North and South America is full of accounts of settlers, captured or adopted by indigenous societies, being given the choice of where they wished to stay and almost invariably choosing to stay with the latter. This even applied to abducted children. Confronted again with their biological parents, most would run back to their adoptive kin for protection. By contrast, Amerindians incorporated into European society by adoption or marriage, including those who - unlike the unfortunate Helena Valero – enjoyed considerable wealth and schooling, almost invariably did just the opposite: either escaping at the earliest opportunity, or having tried their best to adjust, and ultimately failed - returning to indigenous society to live out their last days. (Page 19)
- Many who found themselves enmbroiled in such contests of civilization, if we may call them that, were able to offer clear reasons for their decisions to stay with their erstwhile captors. Some emphasized the virtues of freedom they found in Native American societies, including sexual freedom, but also freedom from the expectation of constant toil in pursuit of land and wealth." Others noted the Indians' reluctance ever to let anyone fall into a condition of poverty, hunger or destitution. It was not so much that they feared poverty themselves, but rather that they found life infinitely more pleasant in a society where no one else was in a position of abject misery… (Page 20)
- Still others noted the ease with which outsiders, taken in by ‘Indian’ families, might achieve acceptance and prominent positions in their adoptive communities, becoming members of chiefly households, or even chiefs themselves. (Page 20)
- By far the most common reasons, however, had to do with the intensity of social bonds they experienced in Native American communities: qualities of mutual care, love and above all happiness, which they found impossible to replicate once back in European settings. 'Security' takes many forms. __There is the security of knowing one has a statistically smaller chance of getting shot with an arrow. And then there's the security of knowing that there are people in the world who will care deeply if one is.__ (Page 20)
