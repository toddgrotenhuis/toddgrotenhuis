## Highlights
### Preface1
- In the end, the most debatable aspect of Bowling Alone was perhaps not the trends it identified. More often, both lay readers and academic experts were concerned with the question of causes. Why had social capital declined so precipitously during the latter half of the twentieth century? ([Location 152](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003DYGOO6&location=152))
- My own views about causation have evolved over twenty years. And I have found that by far the most instructive exercise in my exploration of this question has been to widen the lens on the period of history I was aiming to understand and explain. ([Location 157](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003DYGOO6&location=157))
- I therefore encourage readers who are curious about the broader story of change over time in America’s social capital to look at my latest book, The Upswing: How America Came Together a Century Ago and How We Can Do It Again, which I coauthored with Shaylyn Romney Garrett. It is being published contemporaneously with this new edition of Bowling Alone. ([Location 167](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003DYGOO6&location=167))

- the Social Capital Index, which was an original scholarly contribution of the book23 and combined several metrics and indicators to create a broad measuring tool for understanding community vitality, has been confirmed and reused multiple times in the past twenty years. ([Location 218](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003DYGOO6&location=218))
- My purpose, of course, was to try to contribute to a “revival of American community,” as the subtitle of Bowling Alone signaled. It is now perfectly plain that, in that sense, I have so far failed. ... Indeed, my latest book (The Upswing, coauthored with Shaylyn Romney Garrett) shows unequivocally just how thoroughly America has continued to regress in the intervening twenty years—a downward plunge resulting not merely in fraying community ties but also in worsening economic inequality, greater political polarization, and more cultural individualism.

- The most common criticism of Bowling Alone has been that the prescriptive, hortatory last chapter was simply inadequate to the scope of the problem. And the problem today is even bigger than it was when those critiques were written. ([Location 278](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003DYGOO6&location=278))
### SECTION ONE Introduction
#### CHAPTER 1 Thinking about Social Change in America
- A society of many virtuous but isolated individuals is not necessarily rich in social capital. ([Location 379](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003DYGOO6&location=379))
- The term social capital itself turns out to have been independently invented at least six times over the twentieth century, each time to call attention to the ways in which our lives are made more productive by social ties. ([Location 380](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003DYGOO6&location=380))
- As this array of independent coinages indicates, social capital has both an individual and a collective aspect—a private face and a public face. First, individuals form connections that benefit our own interests. ... a well-connected individual in a poorly connected society is not as productive as a well-connected individual in a well-connected society. And even a poorly connected individual may derive some of the spillover benefits from living in a well-connected community. ([Location 399](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003DYGOO6&location=399))
- Sometimes, as in these cases, reciprocity is specific: I’ll do this for you if you do that for me. Even more valuable, however, is a norm of generalized reciprocity: I’ll do this for you without expecting anything specific back from you, in the confident expectation that someone else will do something for me down the road.

- The Golden Rule is one formulation of generalized reciprocity. ([Location 423](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003DYGOO6&location=423))
