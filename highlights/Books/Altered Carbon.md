## Highlights
- In the kitchen, I loaded up the shard pistol, cast a glance at my own weapon, and left it lying there. Instead I scooped up one of the H grenades and took it back in my other hand. I paused in the doorway to the bedroom and weighed the two pieces of hardware in each palm as if I was trying to decide which was the heavier.

- “Fire in the hole.” ([Location 103](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FBFMZ2&location=103))
- The bed went first, erupting into gouts of white goose down and ripped cloth, then Sarah, caught in the storm as she turned. I saw one leg turned to pulp below the knee, and then the body hits, bloody fistfuls of tissue torn out of her pale flanks as she fell through the curtain of fire.

- Under the mask, his eyes went suddenly unfocused. I lifted the head again and smashed it down again, feeling the skull give soggily with the impact. I ground down against the crunch, lifted and smashed again. There was a roaring in my ears like the maelstrom, and somewhere I could hear my own voice screaming obscenities.

- The little twinges and snags catch up with you later on, and if you’re wise, you just live with them. Every sleeve has a history. If that kind of thing bothers you, you line up over at Syntheta’s or Fabrikon. ([Location 217](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FBFMZ2&location=217))
- I stared at the leaflet in my hands. CAN A MACHINE SAVE YOUR SOUL? it demanded of me rhetorically. ([Location 361](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FBFMZ2&location=361))
- like all men of power, when he talked of prices worth paying, you could be sure of one thing. Someone else was paying. ([Location 3368](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FBFMZ2&location=3368))
- I waited, nerves sprung in case Bay City police stations were as prone to accidental suspect injury as some others I had known. ([Location 3427](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FBFMZ2&location=3427))
- The lawyers I saw there had about as much in common with the man who had defended me at fifteen as automated machine rifle fire has with farting. They were cold, professionally polished, and well on their way up a career ladder that would ensure that despite the uniforms they wore, they would never have to come within a thousand kilometers of a genuine firefight. The only problem they had, as they cruised sharkishly back and forth across the cool marble floor of the court, was in drawing the fine differences between war—mass murder of people wearing a uniform not your own; justifiable loss—mass murder of your own troops, but with substantial gains; and criminal negligence—mass murder of your own troops, without appreciable benefit. I sat in that courtroom for three weeks listening to them dress it like a variety of salads, and with every passing hour the distinctions, which at one point I’d been pretty clear on, grew increasingly vague. I suppose that proves how good they were. After that, straightforward criminality came as something of a relief.

- I looked down at the lettering beneath my feet and thought it through, link by link. “Francisco Franco,” Kawahara said, mistaking the direction of my gaze for focused interest. “Petty tyrant a long time back. He built this place.” “Trepp said it belonged to the Catholics.” Kawahara shrugged. “Petty tyrant with delusions of religion. Catholics get on well with tyranny. It’s in the culture.” ([Location 5092](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FBFMZ2&location=5092))

- Inert viral forms could be owned as subjects for study, or even, as one bizarre test case had proved, private trophies. Ownership or sale of an active military virus, or the codes whereby a dormant virus could be activated, was a U.N. indictable offense, punishable with anything between a hundred and two hundred years storage. In the event of the virus actually being deployed, the sentence could be upped to erasure. Naturally these penalties were applicable only to private citizens, not military commanders or government executives. The powerful are jealous of their toys.

- “Thought not. See, the thing is, they’re looking for borderline psychopathic tendencies. That’s why they do most of their recruiting from the military in the first place.” Trepp looked put out. “I’ve got borderline psychopathic tendencies.” “Yeah, I don’t doubt it, but the point is, the number of civilians with those tendencies and a sense of team spirit is pretty limited. They’re opposing values. The chances of them both arising naturally in the same person are almost nil. Military training takes the natural order and fucks with it. It breaks down any resistance to psychopathic behavior at the same time as it builds fanatical loyalties to the group. Package deal. Soldiers are perfect Envoy material.” ([Location 6109](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FBFMZ2&location=6109))
- After the bombardments, we went in as regime engineers.” As I talked, the tension began to ease out of my throat. I gestured with my cigarette. “That’s a Protectorate euphemism for crush all resistance and install a puppet government.

- was hard to tell which was the most smoothly mechanical, the doors or the black-clad faceless figures that stood guard over them. ([Location 8204](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FBFMZ2&location=8204))
