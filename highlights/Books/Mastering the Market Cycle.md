## Highlights
- There is no single most important thing in investing. ([Location 48](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078977BRM&location=48))
- We humans use our ability to recognize and understand patterns to make our decisions easier, increase benefits and avoid pain. Importantly, we depend on our knowledge of recurring patterns so we won’t have to reconsider every decision from scratch.

### I Why Study Cycles?
- One of the most important foundational elements of my investment philosophy is my conviction that we can’t know what the “macro future” has in store for us in terms of things like economies, markets or geopolitics.

- Very few investors are known for having outperformed through macro forecasting. ([Location 162](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078977BRM&location=162))
- I think we can most gainfully spend our time in three general areas: trying to know more than others about what I call “the knowable”: the fundamentals of industries, companies and securities, being disciplined as to the appropriate price to pay for a participation in those fundamentals, and understanding the investment environment we’re in and deciding how to strategically position our portfolios for it.

- In my view, the greatest way to optimize the positioning of a portfolio at a given point in time is through deciding what balance it should strike between aggressiveness and defensiveness. And I believe the aggressiveness/defensiveness balance should be adjusted over time in response to changes in the state of the investment environment and where a number of elements stand in their cycles.

- Calibrating one’s portfolio position is what this book is mostly about. ([Location 189](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078977BRM&location=189))
- Rather, we can talk about the things that might happen or should happen, and how likely they are to happen. Those things are what I call “tendencies.” ([Location 193](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078977BRM&location=193))
- in my view, risk is primarily the likelihood of permanent capital loss. But there’s also such a thing as opportunity risk: the likelihood of missing out on potential gains. Put the two together and we see that risk is the possibility of things not going the way we want. ([Location 197](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078977BRM&location=197))
- the future should be viewed not as a single fixed outcome that’s destined to happen and capable of being predicted, but as a range of possibilities and—hopefully on the basis of insight into their respective likelihoods—as a probability distribution.
