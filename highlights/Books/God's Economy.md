## Highlights
- Our world is splendidly filled with glorious things and a glorious gospel but is appallingly lacking persons who celebrate these glories with passion and share them with compassion. ([Location 94](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002VBV1RC&location=94))
- The American church seems to be particularly at risk as a secularized consumer mentality conditions us to evaluate our Christian life in terms of what we get out of it ([Location 111](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002VBV1RC&location=111))
### CHAPTER 1 Can We Have Our Pie and Eat It Too?
- The more I read the Bible, the more I wondered if God ever meant for us to wait until death to really start living. ([Location 144](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002VBV1RC&location=144))
- When all your pie is in the sky, you’re on your own when it comes to facing poverty, sickness, loneliness, boredom, or divorce — the very things most of us want God’s help with. ([Location 148](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002VBV1RC&location=148))
- Growing up Southern Baptist in the heyday of the Moral Majority, I set my sights on the White House, convinced that I had a divine appointment to wield America’s money and power on behalf of Jesus. ([Location 165](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002VBV1RC&location=165))
- Something wasn’t working in my simple marriage of Jesus’ gospel with the American Dream. ([Location 181](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002VBV1RC&location=181))
- Money has a way of exposing what our true desires and priorities are. ([Location 200](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002VBV1RC&location=200))
- If we’re down and out, struggling to make ends meet, we like the story of Joseph in prison. It’s encouraging to know that God can make a way when things seem helpless. Joseph’s story helps us remain hopeful and press on. If, on the other hand, we’re materially successful, we like the story of Joseph serving as Pharaoh’s administrator. Joseph’s faithful stewardship impresses us, and we like to think the system will run better with God’s man in the White House. But when Joseph confronts his brothers, we are confronted with the demand to be honest about our true desires. ([Location 234](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002VBV1RC&location=234))
- Beyond the flicker of televised Christianity, more and more followers of Jesus refuse to believe that our only choices are pie-in-the-sky poverty and the materialism of the American Dream. ([Location 263](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002VBV1RC&location=263))
### CHAPTER 2 Hungry for More
- Many preachers note (especially during building campaigns) that Jesus talked more about money than almost anything else. But what concerns Jesus about money isn’t so much how we should use it (though I guarantee he wouldn’t have approved of Bentleys or teeth-whitening) as how it affects our relationship with God. ([Location 304](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002VBV1RC&location=304))
- Poverty was evil because it isolated Karl from the human community. ([Location 356](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002VBV1RC&location=356))
- it seems that money has a way of quietly colonizing our imaginations whether we have it or not. ([Location 371](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002VBV1RC&location=371))
- The demonic power of money, according to the prophet, is that it reduces people to property that can be bought and sold. Then, what’s worse, it convinces the oppressors that God has blessed them. ([Location 450](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002VBV1RC&location=450))
- The radical abundance Jesus invites us into is the economy of a shepherd who lays down his life for his sheep. It is the interruption of every economic system, because it refuses the law of scarcity and insists that the impossible can happen. God’s people can survive for forty years on bread that falls out of the sky. Five thousand people can eat their fill and still have leftovers from a meal of two fish and five loaves of bread. ([Location 462](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002VBV1RC&location=462))
- The abundant life Jesus offers is freedom from the poverty that says some people are worthless and freedom from the wealth that tempts others to forget God. ([Location 469](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002VBV1RC&location=469))
### CHAPTER 3 Eating at God’s Table
- We want abundant life, but we want it on our own terms. ([Location 493](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002VBV1RC&location=493))
- If truly following God’s call to abundant life makes Christians into well-adjusted middle-class citizens, it makes you wonder how Jesus ever got himself executed. ([Location 500](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002VBV1RC&location=500))
- Although we sing songs thanking God for the cross, its actual intrusion into our lives is almost always an offense. ([Location 507](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002VBV1RC&location=507))
- Meals say much about who we value. ([Location 538](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002VBV1RC&location=538))
- True, that’s the harsh reality in a world where the rich spend more on diets than the poorest of the poor spend on food. ([Location 578](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002VBV1RC&location=578))
- Jesus doesn’t assume scarcity, but plenty. ([Location 583](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002VBV1RC&location=583))
- The table is wide enough for everyone, and everyone is invited. ([Location 586](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002VBV1RC&location=586))
- However strange it may seem to us, safe in our polished pews, the economy Jesus preached and practiced was more than wishful thinking. ([Location 594](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002VBV1RC&location=594))
- What we think is stewardship may, in fact, be greed. The giving patterns of people — both in and out of church — suggest that having more money makes people less generous. ([Location 609](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002VBV1RC&location=609))
- Though people in power have access to more resources, they are often hesitant to help those in need, afraid that they might lose their place of influence, get distracted from more important matters, or encourage destructive patterns of helplessness among the needy. ([Location 610](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002VBV1RC&location=610))
- Others were eager to speak for them, to organize them into a power block. ([Location 632](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002VBV1RC&location=632))
- They desperately wanted to make a difference in the world — and they believed they needed power to do it. ([Location 634](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002VBV1RC&location=634))
