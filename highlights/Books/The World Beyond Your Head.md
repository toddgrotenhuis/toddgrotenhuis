- Just as clean air makes respiration possible, silence, in this broader sense, is what makes it possible to think. We give it up willingly when we are in the company of other people with whom we have some relationship, and when we open ourselves to serendipitous encounters with strangers. To be addressed by mechanized means is an entirely different matter. ([Location 185](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00O0G1A6S&location=185))
- We in the liberal societies of the West find ourselves headed toward a similar condition with regard to the resource of attention, because we do not yet understand it to be a resource. ([Location 199](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00O0G1A6S&location=199))
- Because we have allowed our attention to be monetized, if you want yours back you’re going to have to pay for it. ([Location 206](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00O0G1A6S&location=206))

- As the commons gets appropriated, one solution, for those who have the means, is to leave the commons for private clubs such as the business-class lounge. ([Location 207](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00O0G1A6S&location=207))
- Consider that it is those in the business lounge who make the decisions that determine the character of the peon lounge and we may start to see these things in a political light. ([Location 208](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00O0G1A6S&location=208))
- When some people treat the minds of other people as a resource, this is not “creating wealth,” it is a transfer. ([Location 212](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00O0G1A6S&location=212))
- The much-discussed decline of the middle class in recent decades, and the ever greater concentration of wealth in a shrinking elite, may have something to do with the ever more aggressive appropriations of the attentional commons that we have allowed to take place. ([Location 214](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00O0G1A6S&location=214))
- I think we need to sharpen the conceptually murky right to privacy by supplementing it with a right not to be addressed. ([Location 219](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00O0G1A6S&location=219))
- inattentional blindness. ([Location 234](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00O0G1A6S&location=234))
- The idea of a commons is suitable in discussing attention because, first, the penetration of our consciousness by interested parties proceeds very often by the appropriation of attention in public spaces, and second, because we rightly owe to one another a certain level of attentiveness and ethical care.

- To attend to anything in a sustained way requires actively excluding all the other things that grab at our attention. It requires, if not ruthlessness toward oneself, a capacity for self-regulation. ([Location 259](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00O0G1A6S&location=259))

- The researchers’ interpretation of their results is that it isn’t willpower (as conventionally understood) that distinguishes the successful children, it is the ability to strategically allocate their attention so that their actions aren’t determined by the wrong thoughts.

- Without the ability to direct our attention where we will, we become more receptive to those who would direct our attention where they will—to the omnipresent purveyors of marshmallows. ([Location 272](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00O0G1A6S&location=272))
- But if consumer capitalism can go on only by continuing to accelerate the “intensification of nervous stimulation,” there would seem to be a fundamental antagonism between this form of economic life and the individual who inhabits it. That is, we may have a problem. ([Location 275](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00O0G1A6S&location=275))
- Distractibility might be regarded as the mental equivalent of obesity. ([Location 280](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00O0G1A6S&location=280))

- When we inhabit a highly engineered environment, the natural world begins to seem bland and tasteless, like broccoli compared with Cheetos. ([Location 281](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00O0G1A6S&location=281))
- Yet the market ideal of choice and attendant preoccupation with freedom tends toward a monoculture of human types: the late modern consumer self. At least the market seems to have this effect when we are constantly being addressed with hyperpalatable stimuli. ([Location 292](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00O0G1A6S&location=292))
- Especially the bit about our preferences expressing a welling-up of the authentic self. Those preferences have become the object of social engineering, ([Location 303](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00O0G1A6S&location=303))
- Nothing subtle—no feeling that isn’t industrial-strength in its urgency and standardized in its appeal—can arise in such a ruthlessly monetized attentional environment. ([Location 316](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00O0G1A6S&location=316))
- One thing that distinguishes human beings from other animals is that we are evaluative creatures. We can take a critical stance toward our own activities, and aspire to direct ourselves toward objects and projects that we judge to be more worthy than others that may be more immediately gratifying. ([Location 328](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00O0G1A6S&location=328))
- Because it is effortful, we use suppression conservatively. ([Location 342](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00O0G1A6S&location=342))
- human beings are thought to be the only creatures who can deliberately recall something not cued by the environment.13 But we do this only in those stretches of time when the environment is not making urgent claims on our attention. ([Location 350](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00O0G1A6S&location=350))
- I think it is safe to say that our ability to suppress the environment is under greater pressure than it once was. It may be that this pressure is acutely felt only by an adult generation that developed in one attentional landscape and now finds itself inhabiting another, more highly engineered one. Younger people are famously comfortable with it all. The question remains whether we should take comfort in their comfort. ([Location 355](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00O0G1A6S&location=355))
- Behavioral economics is impressed with psychological findings that suggest that the reasons for our actions are generally opaque to us, not objects of rational scrutiny. ([Location 372](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00O0G1A6S&location=372))
- the environment matters, in a stronger way than one supposes if one adopts the interior, fully articulate model of rational agency, on the one hand, or the antimental, brain-centered view, on the other. ([Location 392](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00O0G1A6S&location=392))
- One element of our predicament is that we engage less than we once did in everyday activities that structure our attention. Rituals do this, for example. They answer for us the question “What is to be done next?” and thereby relieve us of the burden of choice and reflection, as when we recite a liturgy. ([Location 394](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00O0G1A6S&location=394))
- They establish narrow and highly structured patterns of attention—what I shall be calling ecologies of attention—that can give coherence to our mental lives, however briefly. ([Location 400](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00O0G1A6S&location=400))
- But in fact, I think the experience of attending to something isn’t easily made sense of within the prevailing Western anthropology that takes autonomy as the central human good. ([Location 413](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00O0G1A6S&location=413))
- Understood literally, autonomy means giving a law to oneself. The opposite of autonomy thus understood is heteronomy: being ruled by something alien to oneself. In a culture predicated on this opposition (autonomy good, heteronomy bad), it is difficult to think clearly about attention—the faculty that joins us to the world—because everything located beyond your head is regarded as a potential source of heteronomy, and therefore a threat to the self. ([Location 415](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00O0G1A6S&location=415))
- The paradox is that the ideal of autonomy seems to work against the development and flourishing of any rich ecology of attention—the sort in which minds may become powerful and achieve genuine independence. ([Location 421](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00O0G1A6S&location=421))
- As atomized individuals called to create meaning for ourselves, we find ourselves the recipients of all manner of solicitude and guidance. ([Location 432](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00O0G1A6S&location=432))
- Discovering your true preferences requires maximizing the number of choices you face: precisely the condition that makes for maximum dissipation of one’s energies. ([Location 435](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00O0G1A6S&location=435))
- Autonomy talk speaks the consumerist language of preference satisfaction. ([Location 435](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00O0G1A6S&location=435))
- Autonomy talk stems from Enlightenment epistemology and moral theory, which did important polemical work in their day against various forms of coercion. Times have changed. The philosophical project of this book is to reclaim the real, as against representations. That is why the central term of approbation in these pages is not “freedom” but “agency.” ([Location 457](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00O0G1A6S&location=457))

- A physical jig reduces the physical degrees of freedom a person must contend with. By seeding the environment with attention-getting objects (such as a knife left in a certain spot) or arranging the environment to keep attention away from something (as, for example, when a dieter keeps certain foods out of easy view), a person can informationally jig it to constrain his mental degrees of freedom. The upshot is that to keep action on track, according to some guiding purpose, one has to keep attention properly directed. ([Location 505](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00O0G1A6S&location=505))
- Once we have achieved competence in the skill, we don’t routinely rely on our powers of concentration and self-regulation—those higher-level “executive” functions that are easily exhausted. Rather, we find ways to recruit our surroundings for the sake of achieving our purposes with a minimum expenditure of these scarce mental resources. ([Location 510](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00O0G1A6S&location=510))

- The point of an assembly line is to replace skilled work with routinized work that can be done by unskilled labor. Early in the twentieth century this gave rise to the saying “Cheap men need expensive jigs; expensive men need only the tools in their toolbox.” ([Location 526](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00O0G1A6S&location=526))
- “advanced cognition depends crucially on our ability to dissipate reasoning: to diffuse achieved knowledge and practical wisdom through complex structures, and to reduce the loads on individual brains by locating those brains in complex webs of linguistic, social, political and institutional constraints.”2 Such constraints might be called cultural jigs. ([Location 536](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00O0G1A6S&location=536))
- we “offload” some of our thinking onto our surroundings, or we incorporate objects in such a way that they come to act like prosthetics. ([Location 548](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00O0G1A6S&location=548))
- We are not so much rational optimizers as creatures who rely on biases and crude heuristics for making important decisions. ([Location 564](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00O0G1A6S&location=564))
- For the ideal of autonomy is built around the notion of a sovereign self, whose sovereignty consists in having everything within full view, available to her as material for her own choice, planning, and optimization. There are no determinants of her actions that she doesn’t have a handle on. This picture doesn’t comfortably admit our dependence on others, or the ways our freedom is ordered by various framing conditions we have inherited, which are not of our own making. ([Location 587](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00O0G1A6S&location=587))
- There was, then, a cultural jig supporting thrift that was richly elaborated in the dominant religion and in our political psychology; a nestled set of mutually reinforcing moral norms gave a certain shape to life in early America (which is not to say that this was the best possible shape). The invention of consumer credit early in the twentieth century did a fair bit to dismantle this jig. ([Location 601](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00O0G1A6S&location=601))
- The norms that cultural jigs express and reinforce tend to be reiterated, fractal-like, along different axes of social life; they are robust in that way. ([Location 608](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00O0G1A6S&location=608))
- By contrast, administrative nudges are a thin attempt to get us to act as if we were virtuous, without any reference to character traits like self-control. ([Location 609](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00O0G1A6S&location=609))
- Character is a kind of jig that is built up through habit, becoming a reliable pattern of responses to a variety of situations. ([Location 616](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00O0G1A6S&location=616))
- Thaler and Sunstein are not enlighteners seeking to expand the empire of rational administration by chasing away settled forms of social authority. Rather, they are drawing attention to the fact that we are already administered in various ways, inescapably, but are generally not aware of it. ([Location 626](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00O0G1A6S&location=626))
- Another way to put this is that the left’s project of liberation led us to dismantle inherited cultural jigs that once imposed a certain coherence (for better and worse) on individual lives. This created a vacuum of cultural authority that has been filled, opportunistically, with attentional landscapes that get installed by whatever “choice architect” brings the most energy to the task—usually because it sees the profit potential. The combined effect of these liberating and deregulating efforts of the right and left has been to ratchet up the burden of self-regulation. Some indication of how well we are bearing this burden can be found in the fact that we are now very fat, very much in debt, and very prone to divorce. The effects of this have not been evenly distributed. To gain admission to the svelte, solvent middle class, and stay there, now requires extraordinary self-discipline. Such discipline is generally inculcated in families. Two self-disciplined people meet in graduate school, mate, and pass their disciplined ways on to their children. But we also make use of external props that are available to those with means: jigs for hire. ([Location 655](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00O0G1A6S&location=655))

- The point is that staying out of jail is much easier with money. The daunting complexity of the demands we have to comply with, and the opportunities for diversion that abound, add up to a pretty compelling case for just staying on the couch in a state of overstimulated avoidance. ([Location 670](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00O0G1A6S&location=670))
- With help such as the kind I was offering at the test prep center, students eventually find their way to graduate school, pair up, and reproduce. What is being reproduced is social capital—all those capacities, habits, relationships, and institutional certifications that a person needs to thrive. Such social capital seems to be more tightly correlated with money capital than ever before. Maybe one reason for this is that the cultural jigs once relied on by the middle class have been widely dismantled, in the name of personal autonomy. ([Location 683](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00O0G1A6S&location=683))
- The blessings of personal autonomy have been expressed with most eloquence, whether of the libertarian or the lefty kind, by opinion-makers who probably have the means to avail themselves of such services. ([Location 690](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00O0G1A6S&location=690))
- This is an instance of “ecological control,” or “morphological computation,” in which “goals are not achieved by micromanaging every detail of the desired action or response but by making the most of robust, reliable sources of relevant order in the bodily or worldly environment of the controller,” ([Location 826](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00O0G1A6S&location=826))
- When we begin to learn a new skill, new equipment often mediates between our bodies and the world, and the loop of perception through action may take a detour through physical phenomena that are quite alien to the natural human body. ([Location 844](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00O0G1A6S&location=844))
- This brings up another uncanny fact about motorcycle steering: the bike goes wherever your gaze is focused. Most important, if your eyes lock on some hazard in the road, you will surely hit it. ([Location 860](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00O0G1A6S&location=860))
- You have to learn to unlock your eyes as quickly as possible from every hazard, and instead look where you want to go. ([Location 865](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00O0G1A6S&location=865))
- Our action programs, visual system, and “affect” (immediate, visceral judgments of good or bad such as happens when we see a spider) are integrated in a way that is adaptive for us, and have achieved a certain automaticity. But when the relation of your body to the world is mediated by a machine, one that requires a very different set of muscle responses to achieve the desired avoidance, then you aren’t well adapted until you have reintegrated muscle response, visual system, and affect into a very different collection of automated responses. ([Location 867](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00O0G1A6S&location=867))
- If Cussins is right, reliance on a speedometer tends to subtly bump us out of a skillful way of driving, and this is due to the interference of objective knowledge with experiential knowledge. ([Location 931](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00O0G1A6S&location=931))
- Abstracting from the concrete objects of their environment, the chimps become better at maximizing their utility. ([Location 955](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00O0G1A6S&location=955))
- The role of attention in the exercise of a skill is to pick out those features of the scene that are pragmatically significant and that therefore, taken together, define “the situation.” In the early stages of learning a skill, explicit propositional knowledge, stated in language for instructional purposes, plays a crucial role in directing attention toward its proper objects. Bathed with attention in this way, these objects then become available for integration with affect and action routines by the subconscious mind, following a close call. ([Location 998](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00O0G1A6S&location=998))
- That is, the array of sensual data that count as pragmatically relevant for grasping the situation may be expanded or shifted through a kind of triangulation with others who were not merely there, but engaged in the same task, facing the same dangers. You debrief one another. The fruit of this conversation enters into your ongoing rehearsal of the experience. If this rehearsed version bears up, and jibes with further experience, it becomes internalized, available to the subconscious mind in coping with future situations. For experiences to become part of the secure, sedimented foundation of a skill, they must be criticized. Other people (and the resources of language) are indispensable. Without them, your experiences are partial, and may sediment as idiosyncratic bad habits. ([Location 1015](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00O0G1A6S&location=1015))
- In other words, they must have the art of philosophical conversation (which is a kind of moral accomplishment). I believe the most competent people in any field do have this art to some degree, though they probably wouldn’t name it as such. ([Location 1024](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00O0G1A6S&location=1024))
- Getting things right requires triangulating with other people. Psychologists therefore would do well to ask whether “metacognition” (thinking critically about your own thinking) is at bottom a social phenomenon. It typically happens in conversation—not idle chitchat, but the kind that aims to get to the bottom of things. I call this an “art” because it requires both tact and doggedness. And I call it a moral accomplishment because to be good at this kind of conversation you have to love the truth more than you love your own current state of understanding. This is, of course, an unusual priority to have, which may help to account for the rarity of real mastery in any pursuit. ([Location 1026](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00O0G1A6S&location=1026))
- Unlike animals that live in the moment and merely cope with their world (however smoothly), we are erotic: we are drawn out of our present selves toward some more skilled future self that we emulate. What it means to be erotic is that we are never fully at home in the world. We are always “on our way.” Or perhaps we should say that this state of being on our way to somewhere else is our peculiar human way of being here in the world. ([Location 1091](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00O0G1A6S&location=1091))
- embodied perception poses a direct challenge to the idea that representation is the fundamental mental process by which we apprehend the world. ([Location 1101](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00O0G1A6S&location=1101))
- virtual reality provides an especially clear point of contrast to the concept of the situated self that I am offering. ([Location 1112](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00O0G1A6S&location=1112))
- But perhaps even thinking will become unnecessary: a fully smart technology should be able to leap in and anticipate our will, using algorithms that discover the person revealed by our previous behavior. ([Location 1175](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00O0G1A6S&location=1175))
- the world will adjust itself to our needs automatically and the discomfiting awareness of objects as being independent of the self will never be allowed to arise in the first place. ([Location 1177](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00O0G1A6S&location=1177))
- In the previous chapter we learned that, on the contrary, your skill set determines what possibilities for action you perceive in your environment, as in the case of the trained martial artist. How we act is not determined in an isolated moment of choice; it is powerfully ordered by how we perceive the situation, how we are attuned to it, and this is very much a function of our previous history of shaping ourselves to the world in a particular way. ([Location 1219](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00O0G1A6S&location=1219))
- But it seems an extreme reaction to take the possibility of such a case as compelling us to ignore the mutual entanglement of will and world, or to posit their segregation as an ideal. ([Location 1229](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00O0G1A6S&location=1229))
- To be rational is, for Kant, precisely not to be situated in the world. ([Location 1236](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00O0G1A6S&location=1236))
