## Highlights
### INTRODUCTION The Original Sin
- It was hard to avoid, Bruch said, the simple fact that these children had, after all, spent their entire lives trying to eat in moderation and so control their weight, or at least thinking about eating less than they did, and yet they remained obese. ([Location 146](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=146))
- But maintaining a lower weight involved “living on a continuous semi-starvation diet,” and they just couldn’t do it, even though obesity made them miserable and social outcasts. ([Location 148](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=148))
- The reason children grow is that they’re secreting hormones that make them do so—in this case, growth hormone. And there is every reason to believe that the growth of our fat tissue leading to overweight and obesity is also driven and controlled by hormones. ([Location 221](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=221))
- whatever hormones or enzymes work to increase our fat accumulation naturally—just as growth hormone makes children grow—are going to be the very likely suspects on which to focus to determine why some of us get fat and others don’t. ([Location 226](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=226))
- First, when insulin levels are elevated, we accumulate fat in our fat tissue; when these levels fall, we liberate fat from the fat tissue and burn it for fuel. ([Location 231](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=231))
- Second, our insulin levels are effectively determined by the carbohydrates we eat—not entirely, but for all intents and purposes. ([Location 233](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=233))
- The science tells us that obesity is ultimately the result of a hormonal imbalance, not a caloric one—specifically, the stimulation of insulin secretion caused by eating easily digestible, carbohydrate-rich foods: refined carbohydrates, including flour and cereal grains, starchy vegetables such as potatoes, and sugars, like sucrose (table sugar) and high-fructose corn syrup. These carbohydrates literally make us fat, and by driving us to accumulate fat, they make us hungrier and they make us sedentary. ([Location 240](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=240))
- stay away from carbohydrate-rich foods, and the sweeter the food or the easier it is to consume and digest—liquid carbohydrates like beer, fruit juices, and sodas are probably the worst—the more likely it is to make you fat and the more you should avoid it. ([Location 247](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=247))
- When thinking about a healthy diet, shouldn’t we think about what’s good for the planet as well as what’s good for us? ([Location 264](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=264))
- Do we have a right to kill animals for our food or put them to work for us in producing ([Location 265](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=265))
### 1 Why Were They Fat?
- “obesigenic” environment in which we now live, meaning an environment that is prone to turning lean people into fat ones. ([Location 325](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=325))
    - Tags: [[definition]] 
- Referring to obesity as a “form of malnutrition” comes with no moral judgments attached, no belief system, no veiled insinuations of gluttony and sloth. It merely says that something is wrong with the food supply and it might behoove us to find out what. ([Location 500](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=500))
### 2 The Elusive Benefits of Undereating...
### 3 The Elusive Benefits of Exercise...
- In the United States, Europe, and other developed nations, the poorer people are, the fatter they’re likely to be. It’s also true that the poorer we are, the more likely we are to work at physically demanding occupations, to earn our living with our bodies rather than our brains. ([Location 666](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=666))
- We base our belief in the fat-burning properties of exercise on the assumption that we can increase our energy expenditure (calories-out) without being compelled to increase our energy intake (calories-in). ([Location 738](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=738))
- Increase the energy you expend and the evidence is very good that you will increase the calories you consume to compensate. ([Location 747](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=747))
- Persons who change their occupation from light to heavy work or vice versa soon develop corresponding changes in their appetite.” ([Location 767](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=767))
### 4 The Significance of Twenty Calories a Day
- Considering the accuracy required to maintain a stable weight, he added, “there is no stranger phenomena than the maintenance of a constant body weight under marked variation in bodily activity and food consumption.” ([Location 948](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=948))
### 5 Why Me? Why There? Why Then?
### 6 Thermodynamics for Dummies, Part 1
- To get fatter and heavier, we have to overeat. We have to consume more calories than we expend. That’s a given. But thermodynamics tells us nothing about why this happens, why we consume more calories than we expend. It only says that if we do, we will get heavier, and if we get heavier, then we did. ([Location 1112](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=1112))
    - Note: Ok, finally admitting its not either/or
### 7 Thermodynamics for Dummies, Part 2
- In short, the energy we consume and the energy we expend are dependent on each other. ([Location 1165](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=1165))
    - Note: better way of talking about "calories in, calories out" being incomplete
### 8 Head Cases
- Much of the last half-century of professional discourse on obesity can be perceived as attempts to circumvent what we could call the “head case” implications of calories-in/calories-out: how to blame obesity on eating too much without actually blaming the fat person for the human weaknesses of self-indulgence and/or ignorance. ([Location 1254](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=1254))
- “Theories that diseases are caused by mental states and can be cured by will power,” Sontag wrote, “are always an index of how much is not understood about the physical terrain of a disease.” ([Location 1268](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=1268))
### 9 The Laws of Adiposity
- The removal of the ovaries literally makes the rat stockpile body fat; the animal either eats more or expends less energy, or both, to compensate. ([Location 1305](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=1305))
- Estrogen happens to suppress or “inhibit” the activity of LPL on fat cells. The more estrogen around, the less LPL will be pulling fat out of the bloodstream and into the fat cells, and the less fat those cells will accumulate. ([Location 1317](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=1317))
- The First Law Body fat is carefully regulated, if not exquisitely so. ([Location 1347](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=1347))
- The implication (our working assumption) is that if someone gets obese it’s because this regulation has been thrown out of whack, not that it’s ceased to exist. ([Location 1351](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=1351))
- That men and women fatten differently tells us that sex hormones play a role in regulating body fat ([Location 1354](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=1354))
- Animals in the wild may be naturally fat (hippopotami, for instance, and whales). They’ll put on fat seasonally, as insulation in preparation for the cold of winter or as fuel for annual migrations or hibernations. Females will fatten in preparation for giving birth; males will fatten to give them a weight advantage in fights for females. But they never get obese, meaning they won’t suffer adverse health consequences from their fat the way humans do. They won’t become diabetic, for instance. ([Location 1362](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=1362))
- It may be true that evolution has singled out humans as the sole species on the planet whose bodies do not work to regulate fat stores carefully in response to periods of both feast and famine, that some people will stockpile so much fat merely because food is available in abundance that they become virtually immobile, but accepting this conclusion requires that we ignore virtually everything we know about evolution. ([Location 1381](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=1381))
    - Note: Does it?
- The Second Law Obesity can be caused by a regulatory defect so small that it would be undetectable by any technique yet invented. ([Location 1388](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=1388))
- The Third Law Whatever makes us both fatter and heavier will also make us overeat. ([Location 1398](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=1398))
- My son’s growth, like every child’s, is caused fundamentally by the action of growth hormones. ([Location 1412](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=1412))
    - Note: Are hormones in our food a factor that could imbalance us over time?
- The only reason to think that this isn’t true, that the cause and effect go in one direction when we get taller (growth causes overeating) and the other when we grow fatter (overeating causes growth), is that this is what we grew up believing and we never stopped to consider if it actually makes sense. The far more reasonable assumption is that growth in both cases determines appetite and even energy expenditure—not the other way around. ([Location 1426](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=1426))
- We don’t get fat because we overeat; we overeat because we’re getting fat. ([Location 1429](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=1429))
- Over the past eighty years, researchers have learned that they can make rats and mice obese by breeding, by surgery (removing the ovaries, for instance), by the manipulation of their diets, and by any number of genetic manipulations. ([Location 1440](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=1440))
- It doesn’t matter, though, what technique is used to make the animals obese; they’ll still get that way, or at least significantly fatter (just as Wade’s rats did), whether or not they can eat any more calories than otherwise identical animals that remain lean. They get obese not because they overeat but because the surgery or breeding or genetic manipulation or even the change in diet has disturbed the regulation of their fat tissue. ([Location 1444](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=1444))
- If a baby rat that is genetically programmed to become obese is put on a diet from the moment it’s weaned, so it can eat no more than a lean rat would eat, if that, and can never eat as much as it would like, it responds by compromising its organs and muscles to satisfy its genetic drive to grow fat. It’s not just using the energy it would normally expend in day-to-day activity to grow fat; it’s taking the materials and the energy it would normally dedicate to building its muscles, organs, and even its brain and using that. ([Location 1476](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=1476))
- We don’t get fat because we overeat; we overeat because we’re getting fat. ([Location 1518](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=1518))

### 10 A Historical Digression on “Lipophilia”
- Bauer considered the fat tissue in obesity akin to malignant tumors. Both have their own agendas, he explained. Tumors are driven to grow and spread and will do so with little relation to how much the person who has that tumor might be eating or exercising. In those who are predisposed to grow obese, fat tissue is driven to grow, to expand with fat, and it will accomplish this goal, just as the tumor does, with little concern about what the rest of the body might be doing. ([Location 1564](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=1564))
### 11 A Primer on the Regulation of Fat
- fat is continuously flowing out of our fat cells and circulating around the body to be used for fuel and, if it’s not used for fuel, returned to the fat cells. This goes on regardless of whether we’ve recently eaten or exercised. ([Location 1648](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=1648))
- Over the course of any twenty-four-hour period, fat from your fat cells will provide a significant portion of the fuel that your cells will burn for energy. The reason nutritionists like to think (and like to tell us) that carbohydrates are somehow the preferred fuel for the body, which is simply wrong, is that your cells will burn carbohydrates before they’ll burn fat. They do so because that’s how the body keeps blood sugar levels in check after a meal. And if you’re eating a carbohydrate-rich diet, as most people do, your cells will have a lot of carbohydrates to burn before they get to the fat. ([Location 1653](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=1653))
- Imagine that you’re eating a meal that contains both carbohydrates and fat, which most meals do. As the fat is digested, it’s shipped off directly to the fat cells for storage. Think of it as being set aside temporarily while the body deals with the carbohydrates, which demand more immediate action. As these carbohydrates are digested, they appear in the bloodstream in the form of glucose, which is the “sugar” in “blood sugar.” (A carbohydrate called “fructose” is a special case, and I’ll discuss that later.) Cells throughout the body will burn this glucose for fuel and use it to replenish their backup fuel supplies, but they can’t keep up with this rising tide of blood sugar unless they get help doing it. This is where the hormone insulin comes in. ([Location 1659](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=1659))
- You’ll start secreting insulin (from the pancreas) even before you start eating—indeed, it’s stimulated just by thinking about eating. ([Location 1666](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=1666))
    - Tags: [[health]] 
- As your blood sugar begins to decrease, and insulin levels decrease along with it, more and more of the fat stored during the meal will be released from fat tissue (or at least it should be) to take up the slack. Some of this fat began life as carbohydrates, and some began life as fat in the diet, but it’s indistinguishable once it finds itself stored in the fat cells. ([Location 1672](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=1672))
- Another way to think of this is that your fat cells work as energy buffers. They provide a place to put the calories that you consumed during a meal and don’t use immediately, and then they release the calories back into the circulation as you need them ([Location 1682](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=1682))
- The fat in our bodies exists in two different forms that serve entirely different purposes. Fat flows in and out of cells in the form of molecules called “fatty acids”; this is also the form we burn for fuel. We store fat in the form of molecules called “triglycerides,” which are composed of three fatty acids (“tri-”) bound together by a molecule of glycerol (“glyceride”). ([Location 1691](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=1691))
- The reason for this role distribution is again surprisingly simple: triglycerides are too big to flow through the membranes that surround every fat cell, whereas fatty acids are small enough to slip through cell membranes with relative ease, and so they do. ([Location 1694](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=1694))
- When a fatty acid flows into a fat cell (or when it’s created in the fat cell from scratch out of glucose), it will be bound up with a glycerol molecule and two other fatty acids, and the result is a triglyceride, a molecule now too big to get out of the fat cell. Now these three fatty acids are stuck in the fat cell until the triglyceride gets disassembled or falls apart, and they can flow out of the cell again and back into the circulation. ([Location 1699](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=1699))
- As a result, anything that works to promote the flow of fatty acids into your fat cells, where they can be bundled together into triglycerides, works to store fat, to make you fatter. Anything that works to break down those triglycerides into their component fatty acids so the fatty acids can escape from the fat cells works to make you leaner. ([Location 1705](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=1705))
- there are dozens of hormones and enzymes that play a role in these processes, and it’s very easy to imagine how they can be disturbed so that too much fat gets in and not enough gets out. ([Location 1708](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=1708))
- you secrete insulin primarily in response to the carbohydrates in your diet, and you do so primarily to keep blood sugar under control.† But the insulin also works simultaneously to orchestrate the storage and use of fat and protein. ([Location 1715](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=1715))
- Insulin accomplishes this job primarily through two enzymes. The first is LPL, lipoprotein lipase, ... Insulin also influences an enzyme that we haven’t discussed, hormone-sensitive… ([Location 1722](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=1722))
- LPL is the enzyme that sticks out from the membranes of different cells and then pulls fat out of the bloodstream and into the cells. If the LPL is on the surface of a muscle cell, then it directs the fat into the muscle to be used for fuel. If it’s on a fat cell, then it makes that fat cell fatter. ([Location 1723](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=1723))
- The LPL breaks down triglycerides in the bloodstream into their component fatty acids… ([Location 1725](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=1725))
- In men, LPL activity is higher in the fat tissue of the gut, so this is where men tend to get fat, whereas it’s low in the fat tissue below the waist. One reason men get fatter above the waist as they age is that they secrete less testosterone, a male sex hormone,… ([Location 1729](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=1729))
- In women, the activity of LPL is high on the fat cells below the waist, which is why they tend to fatten around the hips and butt, and low on the fat cells of the gut. After menopause, the LPL activity in women’s abdominal fat catches up to that of men, and so they tend to put on excess fat there, too. When women get pregnant, LPL activity increases on their butts and hips; this is where they store the calories they’ll need later to nurse their babies. Putting fat on below the waist and behind them also balances the weight of the child growing in their womb in front. After women give birth, the LPL activity below their waist decreases. They lose the… ([Location 1732](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=1732))
- While we’re working out, LPL activity decreases on our fat cells and increases on muscle cells. This prompts the release of fat from our fat tissue, so we can burn it in our muscle cells, which need the fuel. We get a little leaner. So far, so good. But when we’re done exercising, the situation reverses. Now LPL activity on the muscle cells shuts down, LPL activity on the fat cells shoots up, and the fat cells restock whatever fat they lost during the workout. We get fatter again. (This also explains why exercise makes us hungry. Not only do our muscles crave protein after a workout to… ([Location 1739](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=1739))
- Insulin activates LPL on fat cells, particularly the fat cells of the abdomen; it “upregulates” LPL, as researchers say. The more insulin we secrete, the more active the LPL on the fat cells, and the more fat is… ([Location 1745](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=1745))
- Insulin also happens to suppress LPL activity on the muscle cells... ([Location 1747](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=1747))
- HSL works to make fat cells (and us) leaner. It does so by working inside the fat cells to break down triglycerides into their component fatty acids, so that those fatty acids can then escape into the circulation. ([Location 1753](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=1753))
- Insulin also suppresses this enzyme HSL, and so it prevents triglycerides from being broken down inside the fat cells and keeps the outward flow of fatty acids from the fat cells to a minimum. And it takes just a little bit of insulin to accomplish this feat of shutting down HSL and trapping fat in our fat cells.… ([Location 1755](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=1755))
- Insulin also turns on a mechanism in the fat cells to pump in glucose—just as it does in muscle cells—and this increases the amount of glucose the fat cells metabolize. This in turn increases the amount of glycerol molecules (a by-product of glucose metabolism) floating around in the fat cells… ([Location 1758](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=1758))
- To assure we have room to store all that fat, insulin also works to create new fat cells in case the ones we already have are getting full. And insulin signals liver cells not to burn fatty acids but to repackage them into triglycerides and ship them back to the fat tissue. It even triggers the conversion of carbohydrates directly into fatty acids in the liver and in the fat tissue,… ([Location 1761](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=1761))
- In short, everything insulin does in this context works to increase the fat we store and decrease the fat we burn.… ([Location 1764](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=1764))
- Because the insulin level in the bloodstream is determined primarily by the carbohydrates that are consumed—their quantity and quality, as I’ll discuss—it’s those carbohydrates that ultimately determine how much fat we accumulate. ([Location 1780](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=1780))
- Here’s the chain of events: 1.  You think about eating a meal containing carbohydrates. 2. You begin secreting insulin. 3. The insulin signals the fat cells to shut down the release of fatty acids (by inhibiting HSL) and take up more fatty acids (via LPL) from the circulation. 4. You start to get hungry, or hungrier. 5. You begin eating. 6. You secrete more insulin. 7. The carbohydrates are digested and enter the circulation as glucose, causing blood sugar levels to rise. 8. You secrete still more insulin. 9. Fat from the diet is stored as triglycerides in the fat cells, as are some of the carbohydrates that are converted into fat in the liver. 10.  The fat cells get fatter, and so do you. 11.  The fat stays in the fat cells until the insulin level drops.

- One way to think about what hormones do is that they instruct the body to do something—grow and develop (growth hormones), reproduce (sex hormones), flee or fight (adrenaline). They also make the fuel available for those various actions. Among other things, they signal our fat tissue to mobilize fatty acids and make them available for fuel. ([Location 1794](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=1794))
- In this sense, every hormone but insulin works to release fat from our fat tissue. They make us leaner, at least temporarily. These other hormones, though, have a far more difficult time getting fat out of fat tissue if the insulin level in the circulation is elevated. Insulin trumps the effect of other hormones. It’s all very rational. If there’s a lot of insulin around, it should mean there are also a lot of carbohydrates around to burn—that the blood sugar level is high—and so we don’t need or want fatty acids getting in the way. As a result, these other hormones will liberate fat from the fat tissue only when insulin levels are low. (The other hormones work by stimulating HSL to break down triglycerides, but the HSL is so sensitive to insulin that the other hormones can’t overcome its action.) ([Location 1801](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=1801))
- The one meaningful exception is cortisol. This is the hormone we secrete in response to stress or anxiety. Cortisol actually works to put fat into our fat tissue and to get it out. ([Location 1807](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=1807))
- So cortisol makes us store fat both directly (through LPL) and indirectly (through insulin). But then it works to release fat from our fat cells, primarily by stimulating HSL, just like other hormones. So cortisol can make us fatter still when insulin is elevated, but it can also make us leaner, just like every other hormone, when insulin levels are low. And this may explain why some people get fatter when they get stressed, anxious, or depressed and eat more, and some people do the opposite. ([Location 1810](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=1810))
- The one thing we absolutely have to do if we want to get leaner—if we want to get fat out of our fat tissue and burn it—is to lower our insulin levels and to secrete less insulin to begin with. ([Location 1815](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=1815))
    - Tags: [[favorite]] 
- This suggests that anything that makes us secrete more insulin than nature intended, or keeps insulin levels elevated for longer than nature intended, will extend the periods during which we store fat and shorten the periods when we burn it. ([Location 1825](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=1825))
- If insulin remains elevated, the fat isn’t available. Nor is protein, which our cells can also use for fuel if necessary: insulin also works to keep the protein stored away in the muscles. We can’t use the carbohydrates we’ve stored in the liver and muscle tissue, either, because the insulin keeps that supply locked up as well. As a result, the cells find themselves starved for fuel, and we quite literally feel their hunger. Either we eat sooner than we otherwise would have or we eat more when we do eat, or both.

- Meanwhile, our bodies are getting bigger because we’re putting on fat, and so our fuel requirements are increasing. ([Location 1837](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=1837))
- So, as we fatten, our energy demand increases, and our appetite will increase for this reason as well—particularly our appetite for carbohydrates, because this is the only nutrient our cells will burn for fuel when insulin is elevated.

### 12 Why I Get Fat and You Don’t (or Vice Versa)
- Given the same food containing the same amount of carbohydrates, some people will secrete more insulin than others, and those who do are likely to put on more fat and have less energy. Their bodies work to keep blood sugar levels under control, because high blood sugar is toxic, and they’re willing to overstuff their fat cells, if necessary, to do it. ([Location 1884](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=1884))
- But another important factor is just how sensitive to insulin your cells happen to be and how quickly they become insensitive—the property called “insulin resistance”—in response to the insulin you secrete. ([Location 1887](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=1887))
- One way to think about it is that your cells make the decision that they don’t want any more glucose than they’re already getting—too much glucose is toxic for cells, too—so they make it harder for insulin to do its job and get the glucose out of the bloodstream. ([Location 1892](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=1892))
- Fat cells, muscle cells, liver cells don’t all become resistant to insulin at the same time, to the same extent, or in the same way. Some of these cells will become more or less sensitive to insulin than others, which means the same amount of insulin will have a greater or lesser effect on different tissues. ([Location 1902](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=1902))
- The more sensitive a particular tissue is to insulin, the more glucose it will take up when insulin is secreted. If it’s muscle, it will store more glucose as glycogen and burn more for fuel. If it’s fat, it will store more fat and release less. ([Location 1906](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=1906))
- Here’s another complication: how your tissues respond to insulin changes will change with time (and in response to your diet, as I’ll discuss shortly). As you get older, you get more insulin-resistant, but this almost invariably happens to your muscle tissue first and only later, if at all, to your fat tissue. ([Location 1912](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=1912))
- Once again, what appears to be a cause of fattening—the slowing of our metabolism—is really an effect. You don’t get fat because your metabolism slows; your metabolism slows because you’re getting fat. ([Location 1926](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=1926))
- Fat children tend to be born of fat parents, in part because of all the ways that our genes control our insulin secretion, the enzymes that respond to insulin, and how and when we become resistant to insulin. ([Location 1932](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=1932))
- As the pancreas in that child develops, it apparently responds to this higher dose of glucose by developing more insulin-secreting cells. So, the higher the blood sugar in the pregnant mother, the more insulin-secreting cells her child will develop, and the more insulin the child will secrete as it gets close to birth. The baby will now be born with more fat, and it will have a tendency to oversecrete insulin and become insulin-resistant itself as it gets older. ([Location 1936](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=1936))
- This suggests that, as the obesity epidemic took off, and we all began getting fatter, we began to program more and more of our children from the first few months of their existence to get fatter still. In fact, it wouldn’t be surprising if this particular vicious cycle is one cause of the obesity epidemic. Thus we have more than our own health to consider when we get fat. Our children, too, may pay a price, and their children. And each successive generation may find it that much harder to undo the problem. ([Location 1945](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=1945))
### 13 What We Can Do
- Whether you’re born predisposed to get fat is beyond your control. What Adiposity 101 teaches us, though, is that this predisposition is set off by the carbohydrates we eat—by their quantity and their quality. ([Location 1959](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=1959))
- The most fattening foods are the ones that have the greatest effect on our blood sugar and insulin levels. These are the concentrated sources of carbohydrates, and particularly those that we can digest quickly: anything made of refined flour (bread, cereals, and pasta), liquid carbohydrates (beers, fruit juices, and sodas), and starches (potatoes, rice, and corn). These foods flood the bloodstream quickly with glucose. ([Location 1966](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=1966))
    - Tags: [[health]] [[favorite]] 
- These foods are also, almost invariably, the cheapest calories available. ([Location 1971](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=1971))
- Given an apple and a potato of the same weight, the potato will have a significantly greater effect on blood sugar, which suggests that it should be more fattening. But that doesn’t mean fruit won’t fatten some people. ([Location 1986](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=1986))
- fructose is uniquely fattening as carbohydrates go. ([Location 1989](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=1989))
- High-fructose corn syrup, in the form we typically get it in juices, sodas, and fruity yogurts, is 55 percent fructose (which is why it’s known in the food industry as HFCS-55) 42 percent glucose, and 3 percent other carbohydrates. ([Location 2000](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=2000))
- When we digest sugar or high-fructose corn syrup, much of the glucose ends up in the general circulation, raising our blood sugar levels. The fructose, however, is metabolized almost exclusively in the liver, which has the necessary enzymes to do it. ([Location 2009](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=2009))
- Our livers respond to this flood of fructose by turning much of it into fat and shipping it to our fat tissue. This is why even forty years ago biochemists referred to fructose as the most “lipogenic” carbohydrate—it’s the one we convert to fat most readily. Meanwhile, the glucose that comes with the fructose raises blood sugar levels and stimulates insulin secretion and puts the fat cells in the mode to store whatever calories come their way—including the fat generated in the liver from the fructose. ([Location 2016](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=2016))
- quite possible that if we never ate these sugars we might never become fat or diabetic, even if the bulk of our diet were still starchy carbohydrates and flour. ([Location 2026](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=2026))
- Once you do start to fatten, if you want to stop the process and reverse it, these sugars have to be the first to go. ([Location 2029](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=2029))
- Alcohol is a special case. Alcohol is metabolized mostly in the liver. Some 80 percent of the calories from a shot of vodka, for instance, will go straight to the liver to be converted into a small amount of energy and a large amount of a molecule called “citrate.” The citrate then fuels the process that makes fatty acids out of glucose. So alcohol will increase the production of fat in the liver, which probably explains alcoholic fatty liver syndrome. It might also make us fatter elsewhere, although whether we store these fats as fat or burn them might depend on whether we eat or drink carbohydrates with the alcohol, which we usually do.

### 14 Injustice Collecting
- if you’re predisposed to get fat and want to be as lean as you can be without compromising your health, you have to restrict carbohydrates and so keep your blood sugar and insulin levels low. ([Location 2042](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=2042))
- The message of Adiposity 101 is simple enough: if you’re predisposed to get fat and want to be as lean as you can be without compromising your health, you have to restrict carbohydrates and so keep your blood sugar and insulin levels low. ([Location 2042](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=2042))
- That only some people get fat from eating carbohydrates (just as only some get lung cancer from smoking cigarettes) doesn’t change the fact that if you’re one of those who do, you’ll only lose fat and keep it off if you avoid these foods. ([Location 2045](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=2045))
- This is not a coincidence. It’s clear from animal research that the foods animals will preferentially eat perhaps to excess are those that most quickly supply energy to the cells—easily digestible carbohydrates. ([Location 2051](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=2051))
- Even before we begin eating, insulin works to increase our feeling of hunger. Remember, we begin secreting insulin just by thinking about eating ([Location 2057](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=2057))
- So our experience of hunger actually increases just by thinking about eating, and then it increases further with the first few bites we take. ([Location 2060](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=2060))
- The insulin makes us hungry by temporarily diverting nutrients out of the circulation and into storage, and this, in turn, makes us savor our first bites even more than we otherwise would. The greater the blood sugar and insulin response to a particular food, the more we like it—the better we think it tastes. ([Location 2068](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=2068))
- This palatability-by-blood-sugar-and-insulin response is almost assuredly exaggerated in people who are fat or predisposed to get that way. And the fatter they get, the more they’ll crave carbohydrate-rich foods, because their insulin will be more effective at stashing fat in their fat tissue and protein in their muscle, where they can’t be used for fuel. ([Location 2070](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=2070))
- If we believe the animal research, then sugar and high-fructose corn syrup are addictive in the same way that drugs are and for much the same biochemical reasons.* ([Location 2086](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=2086))
- The foods that make us fat also make us crave precisely the foods that make us fat. ([Location 2088](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=2088))
- The more fattening they are, and the more predisposed you are to get fat when you eat them, the greater the cravings. ([Location 2089](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=2089))
### 15 Why Diets Succeed and Fail
### 16 A Historical Digression on the Fattening Carbohydrate
- Dancel also noted, as Brillat-Savarin had and others would, that carnivorous animals are never fat, whereas herbivores, living exclusively on plants, often are: ([Location 2223](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=2223))
- Foods to be avoided:
  1. Bread, and everything else made with flour
  2. Cereals, including breakfast cereals and milk puddings
  3. Potatoes and all other white root vegetables
  4. Foods containing much sugar
  5. All sweets
  You can eat as much as you like of the following foods:
  1. Meat, fish, birds
  2. All green vegetables
  3. Eggs, dried or fresh
  4. Cheese
  5. Fruit, if unsweetened or sweetened with saccharin, except bananas and grapes... ([Location 2276](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=2276))
- But there was another problem as well. Health officials had come to believe that dietary fat causes heart disease, and that carbohydrates are what these authorities would come to call “heart-healthy.” ([Location 2344](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=2344))
- This belief in the carbohydrate as “heart-healthy” started in the 1960s and it couldn’t be reconciled with the idea that carbohydrates make us fat. ([Location 2350](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=2350))
- “carbohydrate is driving insulin is driving fat.” ([Location 2357](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=2357))
### 17 Meat or Plants?
- Public-health experts call this a “nutrition transition,” and it’s invariably accompanied by a disease transition as well—the appearance of a collection of chronic diseases that are now known as Western diseases for just this reason. These diseases include obesity, diabetes, heart disease, hypertension and stroke, cancer, Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias, cavities, periodontal disease, appendicitis, ulcers, diverticulitis, gallstones, hemorrhoids, varicose veins, and constipation. ([Location 2462](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=2462))
- Eat Western diets, get Western diseases—notably obesity, diabetes, heart disease, and cancer. ([Location 2471](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=2471))
- Pick a disease from the list of Western diseases, and a pair of locations—one urban, say, and one rural, or one Westernized and one not—compare people in the same age groups, and the disease will be more common in the urban and Westernized locations and less common outside them. ([Location 2483](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=2483))
- when isolated populations start eating Western foods, sugar and white flour are invariably the first, because these foods could be transported around the world as items of trade without spoiling or being devoured on the way by rodents or insects. ([Location 2512](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=2512))
### 18 The Nature of a Healthy Diet
- Since carbohydrates make us fat, it follows that the best and perhaps only way to avoid becoming fat is to avoid the carbohydrate-rich foods that are responsible. For those who are already fat, this implies that the best and perhaps only way to become lean again is to do the same. ([Location 2542](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=2542))
- if you can lose weight without hunger, aren’t you more likely to maintain that way of eating than one that requires indefinite semi-starvation? ([Location 2566](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=2566))
- The argument that a diet that restricts fattening carbohydrates will be lacking in essential nutrients—including vitamins, minerals, amino acids—does not hold up. First, the foods that you would be avoiding are the fattening ones, not leafy green vegetables and salads. This alone should take care of any superficial anxieties about vitamin or mineral deficiencies. Moreover, the fattening carbohydrates that are restricted—starches, refined carbohydrates, and sugars—are virtually absent essential nutrients in any case. ([Location 2567](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=2567))
- Vitamin C is the one vitamin that is relatively scarce in animal products. But it appears to be the case, as it certainly is for the B vitamins, that the more fattening carbohydrates we consume, the more of these vitamins we need. We use B vitamins to metabolize glucose in our cells. So, the more carbohydrates we consume, the more glucose we burn (instead of fatty acids), and the more B vitamins we need from our diets. Vitamin C uses the same mechanism to get into cells (where it’s needed) that glucose does, so the higher our blood sugar level, the more glucose enters the cells and the less vitamin C. Insulin also inhibits what’s called the uptake of vitamin C by the kidney, which means that when we eat carbohydrates we excrete vitamin C with our urine rather than retaining it, as we should, and using it. Without carbohydrates in the diet, there’s every indication that we would get all the vitamin C we ever needed from animal products.

- physicians have been using ketogenic diets to treat and even cure otherwise intractable childhood epilepsy since the 1930s. ([Location 2613](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=2613))
- (The fatter we are, or at least the more obese we are, the more likely we are to get virtually every major chronic disease.) ([Location 2633](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=2633))

- As a nation, we were told to eat less fat and less saturated fat, which we did, or at least tried to do—saturated-fat consumption steadily declined over the years that followed, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture statistics—and yet, rather than getting leaner, we got fatter. What’s more, the incidence of heart disease has not even diminished, which goes against expectations, if eating less fat or saturated fat makes a difference. ([Location 2662](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=2662))
- Researchers have continued to demonstrate that cholesterol-lowering drugs can prevent heart attacks and apparently allow some people to live longer (at least those who are at particularly high risk of a heart attack). But it has still not been demonstrated that either low-fat or low-saturated-fat diets will do the same. ([Location 2689](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=2689))
- what drugs do and diets do are two entirely different things. Changing the nutrient content of our diets has many effects throughout our bodies, and many effects on different risk factors for heart disease, as do cholesterol-lowering drugs. That a particular fat in the diet raises LDL cholesterol, compared with, say, other fats or carbohydrates, does not mean it increases our risk of heart disease or is otherwise deleterious to our health. ([Location 2734](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=2734))
- The higher your level of circulating triglycerides (which are transported in the same lipoprotein particles that carry cholesterol), the greater the likelihood that you’ll have a heart attack. This is not controversial. But it’s the carbohydrates we eat that elevate triglyceride levels; fat, saturated or not, has nothing to do with them. ([Location 2745](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=2745))
- For women, HDL levels are so good at predicting future heart disease that they are, effectively, the only predictors of risk that matter. ([Location 2752](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=2752))
- The advice we’ve been given to lower our total and LDL cholesterol and our body weight—eat less saturated fat and more carbohydrates—simply contradicts the advice we could have been given instead to raise our HDL, and HDL, again, is a far better predictor of heart disease. ([Location 2760](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=2760))
- In total, more than 70 percent of the fat in lard will improve your cholesterol profile compared with what would happen if you replaced that lard with carbohydrates. The remaining 30 percent will raise LDL cholesterol (bad) but also raise HDL (good). In other words, and hard as this may be to believe, if you replace the carbohydrates in your diet with an equal quantity of lard, it will actually reduce your risk of having a heart attack. It will make you healthier. The same is true for red meat, bacon and eggs, and virtually any other animal product we might choose to eat instead of the carbohydrates that make us fat. (Butter is a slight exception, because only half the fat will definitively improve your cholesterol profile; the other half will raise LDL but also raise HDL.) ([Location 2786](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=2786))
- This is what happened to those who ate mostly fat and protein:
  1) They lost at least as much weight, if not considerably more.
  2) Their HDL cholesterol went up.
  3) Their triglycerides went way down.
  4) Their blood pressure went down.
  5) Their total cholesterol remained about the same.
  6) Their LDL cholesterol went up slightly.
  7) Their risk of having a heart attack decreased significantly. ([Location 2801](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=2801))
- To complicate matters, not all LDL particles appear to be equally harmful, or “atherogenic,” which is the term used by the experts to describe something that causes atherosclerosis or makes it worse. Some of the LDL in our circulation is large and buoyant, and some is small and dense, and there are gradations in between. The small and dense LDL particles appear to be the atherogenic ones, the ones we want to avoid. They work themselves into the walls of our arteries and begin the process of forming plaques. The large, buoyant LDL particles appear to be harmless. This is important because carbohydrate-rich diets not only lower HDL and raise triglycerides, they also make LDL small and dense. These three effects all increase our risk of heart disease. When we eat high-fat diets and avoid carbohydrates, the opposite happens: HDL goes up, triglycerides go down, and the LDL in the circulation becomes larger and fluffier. ([Location 2842](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=2842))
- The triglyceride-lowering effect of a low-carbohydrate diet leads to an increase in LDL particle size, which is known to decrease atherogenicity. ([Location 2857](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=2857))
- All these conditions are associated with the same cluster of what the experts call “lipid” abnormalities—low HDL, high triglycerides, and small, dense LDL. And all of these are triggered by the insulin resistance and the elevated insulin secretion that accompanies it, by the carbohydrates in our diet, and maybe the sugars (sucrose and high-fructose corn syrup) in particular. ([Location 2876](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=2876))
- What metabolic syndrome tells us is that heart disease and diabetes are not caused by individual risk factors—low HDL, for instance, or high triglycerides, or small, dense LDL—but by insulin resistance and elevated levels of insulin and blood sugar playing havoc with cells everywhere. ([Location 2892](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=2892))
- The insulin works on the fat cells to make us accumulate fat, and the expanding fat cells then release what are called “inflammatory molecules” (“cytokines,” in the technical lingo) that have adverse effects throughout the body. It works on the liver to convert carbohydrates into fat, and this fat (triglycerides) is sent off into the bloodstream on the particles that eventually become small, dense LDL. It works on the kidney to raise blood pressure by reabsorbing sodium (and so has the same effect as eating extreme amounts of salt) and by impairing the secretion of uric acid, which also accumulates to unhealthy levels in the blood stream. (High uric-acid levels cause gout, which is also associated with obesity and diabetes, and the incidence of gout, too, is increasing in Western societies.) The insulin also works on the artery walls to stiffen them and cause the accumulation of triglycerides and cholesterol in the budding atherosclerotic plaques. ([Location 2895](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=2895))

- While this is happening, the chronically elevated blood sugar level that goes along with insulin resistance creates a host of problems on its own. It causes oxidative stress throughout the body. (The reason we’re always told to consume foods rich with antioxidants is to combat or prevent this oxidative stress.) And it leads to the creation of advanced glycation end products, which seem to cause everything from the stiffening of our arteries to the aging of our skin and the premature aging that is part and parcel of diabetes. ([Location 2901](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=2901))
- We know now that carbohydrates make us fat, and it’s been demonstrated in numerous clinical trials that low-carbohydrate, high-fat diets improve each and every one of the metabolic and hormonal abnormalities of metabolic syndrome—the low HDL, the high triglycerides, the small, dense LDL, the high blood pressure, and the insulin resistance and chronically elevated levels of insulin. This suggests the obvious: that the same carbohydrates that make us fat are the ones that cause metabolic syndrome. And it tells us that the best and perhaps only way to treat the condition, as with obesity and overweight, is to avoid carbohydrate-rich foods, particularly the ones we digest easily, and sugars. ([Location 2911](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=2911))
- both Alzheimer’s disease and most cancers—including breast cancer and colon cancer—are associated with metabolic syndrome, obesity, and diabetes. ([Location 2917](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=2917))
### 19 Following Through
- This is not a diet book, because it’s not a diet we’re discussing. Once you accept the fact that carbohydrates—not overeating or a sedentary life—will make you fat, then the idea of “going on a diet” to lose weight, or what the health experts would call a “dietary treatment for obesity,” no longer holds any real meaning. Now the only subjects worth discussing are how best to avoid the carbohydrates responsible—the refined grains, the starches, and the sugars—and what else we might do to maximize the benefits to our health. ([Location 2968](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=2968))
- Eat as much as you like of meat, fish, fowl, eggs, and leafy green vegetables. Avoid starches, grains, and sugars and anything made from them (including bread, sweets, juices, sodas), and learn for yourself whether and how much fruit and non-starchy vegetables (such as peas, artichokes, and cucumbers) your body can tolerate. ([Location 2998](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=2998))
- know from clinical trials that carbohydrate-restricted, eat-as-much-as-you-like diets work and that they have the expected beneficial effects on metabolic syndrome and thus our risk of heart disease. But that’s the extent of the reliable knowledge so far. ([Location 3007](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=3007))
- The fewer carbohydrates we consume, the leaner we will be. This is clear. But there’s no guarantee that the leanest we can be will ever be as lean as we’d like. This is a reality to be faced. As I discussed, there are genetic variations in fatness and leanness that are independent of diet. Multiple hormones and enzymes affect our fat accumulation, and insulin happens to be the one hormone that we can consciously control through our dietary choices. ([Location 3015](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=3015))

- This means that there’s no one-size-fits-all prescription for the quantity of carbohydrates we can eat and still lose fat or remain lean. For some, staying lean or getting back to being lean might be a matter of merely avoiding sugars and eating the other carbohydrates in the diet, even the fattening ones, in moderation: pasta dinners once a week, say, instead of every other day. For others, moderation in carbohydrate consumption might not be sufficient, and far stricter adherence is necessary. And for some, weight will be lost only on a diet of virtually zero carbohydrates, and even this may not be sufficient to eliminate all our accumulated fat, or even most of it. ([Location 3021](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=3021))

- But the fact is that we are trying to counteract a regulatory disorder of fat metabolism, one that may have been years or decades in the making. Reversing the process might take more than a few months or even a few years as well. ([Location 3043](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=3043))
- But one other factor has to be taken into account: allowing some carbohydrates into the diet for some individuals may be like allowing ex-smokers a few cigarettes or reformed alcoholics the occasional drink.‡ Some may be able to deal with it; some may find it is a slippery slope. The occasional dessert on special occasions may become a weekly luxury, then biweekly, and finally nightly, and suddenly you’ve decided that carbohydrate restriction failed as a weight-loss regimen because you failed to stick with it and regained the weight. ([Location 3079](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=3079))
- The hunger that accompanies our attempts to eat fewer calories is an unavoidable physiological phenomenon; the craving for carbohydrates is more like an addiction. It is the consequence, at least in part, of insulin resistance and the chronically elevated levels of insulin that go with it, and thus caused by the carbohydrates in the first place. Sugars are a special case. As I discussed earlier, sugar appears to be addictive in the brain in the same way in which cocaine, nicotine, and heroin are. This suggests that the relatively intense cravings for sugar—a sweet tooth—may be explained by the intensity of the dopamine secretion in the brain when we consume sugar. Whether the addiction is in the brain or the body or both, the idea that sugar and other easily digestible carbohydrates are addictive also implies that the addiction can be overcome if you make the effort and have sufficient patience. This is not the case with hunger itself. Avoiding carbohydrates will lower your insulin level. Given time, this should reduce or eliminate the cravings. It could, however, take longer than you’d expect or ideally like. ([Location 3092](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=3092))
- The implication is that for some, at least, long-term success may be more likely if no compromise is allowed. ([Location 3107](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=3107))
- There are very good reasons to be physically active, but weight loss, as I discussed earlier, does not appear to be one of them. ([Location 3133](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=3133))
- The short-term symptoms of these high-protein, low-fat, low-carbohydrate diets, these protein-metabolism experts point out, are weakness, nausea, and diarrhea. These symptoms will disappear when the protein content is reduced to a more moderate 20 to 25 percent of calories and fat content is increased to compensate. ([Location 3154](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=3154))
- Whether or not a diet that is 75 percent fat and 25 percent protein is healthier than one that is 65 percent fat and 35 percent protein is an open question. ([Location 3160](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=3160))
- This shift, though, can come with side effects. These can include weakness, fatigue, nausea, dehydration, diarrhea, constipation, a condition known as postural, or orthostatic, hypotension—if you stand up too quickly, your blood pressure drops precipitously, and you can get dizzy or even pass out—and the exacerbation of preexisting gout. ([Location 3166](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=3166))
- The more technical term for carbohydrate withdrawal is “keto-adaptation,” because the body is adapting to the state of ketosis that results from eating fewer than sixty or so grams of carbohydrates a day. ([Location 3172](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=3172))
- As I mentioned in passing earlier, insulin signals our kidneys to reabsorb sodium, which in turn causes water retention and raises blood pressure. When insulin levels drop, as they do when we restrict carbohydrates, our kidneys will excrete the sodium they’ve been retaining and with it water. For most people this is beneficial, and it’s the reason why blood pressure comes down with carbohydrate restriction. (This water loss, which can be a half-dozen pounds or more in a two-hundred-pounder, can constitute most of the early weight loss.) For some individuals, though, the body will perceive the water loss as something to be prevented. It does so through a web of compensatory responses that can lead to water retention and what are called electrolyte imbalances (the kidneys excrete potassium to save sodium), and the result is the side effects just cited. The reaction can be countered, as Phinney has noted, by adding sodium back into the diet: taking a gram or two of sodium a day (a half to one teaspoon of salt) or drinking a couple of cups of chicken or beef broth daily, which is what Westman, Vernon, and other physicians now prescribe.

### AFTERWORD TO THE ANCHOR EDITION
- when it comes to regulating our weight, what we need to care about is the effect those nutrients have on the hormonal regulation of the fat tissue. ([Location 3227](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=3227))
- Restrict carbohydrates and fat is mobilized from the fat tissue and burned for fuel; appetite is reduced, as a result, and more energy is expended. ([Location 3230](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=3230))
- Any diet can be made healthy or at least healthier—from vegan to meat-heavy—if the high-glycemic-index carbohydrates and sugars are removed, or reduced significantly. ([Location 3239](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=3239))
- a likely scenario is that you’ll eat more green vegetables when you’re carb-restricting than not, because you’re likely to substitute more green leafy vegetables and salads for the starchy vegetables, pasta, and bread that you’re not eating. ([Location 3265](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=3265))

- The genes responsible for obesity or a predisposition to gain weight seem to also be the genes that determine how we respond to the carbohydrates in our diet—how much insulin we secrete in response, how sensitive our lean and fat tissue is to that insulin and other variables as well. ([Location 3307](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=3307))
- The most important and most easily measured would be waist circumference. But other factors include small, dense LDL (or a high apoB or LDL particle number), high triglycerides, low HDL cholesterol, high blood pressure, and high fasting glucose. ([Location 3322](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=3322))
- A likely scenario is that sugars are the primary cause of insulin resistance and once we become insulin resistant all carb-rich foods, or at the least easily digestible, refined carbohydrates, are problematic and can exacerbate metabolic syndrome, fat accumulation, diabetes, and the chronic diseases like heart disease and cancer that are associated with these disorders. ([Location 3336](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=3336))
- A more likely scenario is that if we reduce the quantity of carbohydrates in our diet and improve the quality, we’ll reduce insulin levels, and that will not only reduce our fat stores, but increase the energy we have for physical activity, and so our desire to do it, and improve our sleep patterns as well.

### APPENDIX The “No Sugar, No Starch” Diet
- For most effective weight loss, you will need to keep the total number of carbohydrate grams to fewer than 20 grams per day. ([Location 3375](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=3375))
- FOODS THAT MUST BE EATEN EVERY DAY:
  Salad Greens: 2 cups a day.

  Bouillon: 2 cups daily—as needed for sodium replenishment. Clear broth (consommé) is strongly recommended, unless you are on a sodium-restricted diet for hypertension or heart failure. ([Location 3388](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=3388))
- FOODS ALLOWED IN LIMITED QUANTITIES: Cheese: up to 4 ounces a day. Includes hard, aged cheeses such as Swiss and Cheddar, as well as Brie, Camembert, blue, mozzarella, Gruyère, cream cheese, goat cheeses. Avoid processed cheeses, such as Velveeta. Check the label; carbohydrate count should be less than 1 gram per serving. Cream: up to 4 tablespoonfuls a day. Includes heavy, light, or sour cream (not half and half). Mayonnaise: up to 4 tablespoons a day. Duke’s and Hellmann’s are low-carb. Check the labels of other brands. Olives (Black or Green): up to 6 a day. Avocado: up to 1/2 of a fruit a day. Lemon/Lime Juice: up to 4 teaspoonfuls a day. Soy Sauces: up to 4 tablespoons a day. Kikkoman is a low-carb brand. Check the labels of other brands. Pickles, Dill or Sugar-Free: up to 2 servings a day. Mt. Olive makes sugar-free pickles. Check the labels for carbohydrates and serving size. Snacks: Pork rinds/skins; pepperoni slices; ham, beef, turkey, and other meat roll-ups; deviled eggs. ([Location 3397](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=3397))
- Sugars are simple carbohydrates. Avoid these kinds of foods: white sugar, brown sugar, honey, maple syrup, molasses, corn syrup, beer (contains barley malt), milk (contains lactose), flavored yogurts, fruit juice, and fruit. ([Location 3412](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=3412))
- Starches are complex carbohydrates. Avoid these kinds of foods: grains (even “whole” grains), rice, cereals, flour, cornstarch, breads, pastas, muffins, bagels, crackers, and “starchy” vegetables such as slow-cooked beans (pinto, lima, black beans), carrots, parsnips, corn, peas, potatoes, French fries, potato chips. ([Location 3414](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=3414))
- Olive oil and peanut oil are especially healthy oils and are encouraged in cooking. ([Location 3418](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=3418))
- For salad dressings, the ideal dressing is a homemade oil-and-vinegar dressing, with lemon juice and spices as needed. Blue-cheese, ranch, Caesar, and Italian are also acceptable if the label says 1 to 2 grams of carbohydrate per serving or less. ([Location 3419](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=3419))
- Avoid food with sugar alcohols (such as sorbitol and maltitol) for now, because they occasionally cause stomach upset, although they may be permitted in limited quantities in the future. ([Location 3427](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=3427))
- The best beverage is water. Essence-flavored seltzers (zero carbs) and bottled spring and mineral waters are also good choices. ([Location 3429](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=3429))
- At first, avoid alcohol consumption on this diet. At a later point in time, as weight loss and dietary patterns become well established, alcohol in moderate quantities, if low in carbohydrates, may be added back into the diet. ([Location 3434](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=3434))
- The following items are NOT on the diet: sugar, bread, cereal, flour-containing items, fruits, juices, honey, whole or skimmed milk, yogurt, canned soups, dairy substitutes, ketchup, sweet condiments and relishes. ([Location 3442](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=3442))
- Avoid these common mistakes: Beware of “fat-free” or “lite” diet products, and foods containing “hidden” sugars and starches (such as coleslaw or sugar-free cookies and cakes). Check the labels of liquid medications, cough syrups, cough drops, and other over-the-counter medications that may contain sugar. Avoid products that are labeled “Great for Low-Carb Diets!” ([Location 3444](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=3444))
