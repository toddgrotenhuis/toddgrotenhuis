## Highlights
- Increasing numbers of people are willing to share intimate aspects of their life with anyone who will listen. (Page 1)
- Many of us require music, television, or radio to get anything done, and some even admit that the media are a hedge against loneliness. (Page 1)
- corporations, advertisers, and politicians create an exaggerated fear of things that are made to appear unusual in degree or pervasiveness (Page 1)
- Real fears are magnified by the experience of loneliness. (Page 1)
- “moral minimalism,” avoiding conflict by not getting involved in other people’s lives. (Page 2)

- loneliness is the nucleus of psychiatry (Page 2)
    - Note: Quoting J.H. Van den Berg
- Causality becomes superfluous, in this view, if the symptoms can be controlled or eliminated. (Page 2)
    - Note: We must embrace the complexity of both (treatment and origin)
- Horwitz distinguishes between the concepts of mental disorder and mental disease. (Page 2)
- Emotions and emotional systems vary from culture to culture. And this has serious implications for their functioning. (Page 3)
- the medicalization of deviance represents a technological approach to its control. (Page 3)
- modern medicine has moved from warding off death to managing life. (Page 3)
- The task of modern medicine and related helping professions is to bring the individual’s normal behavior closer to the perfect lifestyle as defined by medical technology. (Page 4)
- technology is concomitantly a mechanism of control and the sociological factor most responsible for mental disorders. (Page 4)
- Public confession of the patient’s conflict with others and their antagonism toward him is used to bring the disease to a dramatic denouement. (Page 5)
- Confession not only symbolically integrated the community and the spirit world but also reunited the patient with the community. (Page 5)
- All of them relate mental disorders to either capitalism or technology or both. (Page 5)
- The assumption seems to be that stress may be a “trigger” that releases an internal dysfunction of some psychological system. (Page 6)
- culture thus challenges groups and individuals; some become stronger as a result, others weaker. Over time. And without decisive change, the number of those able to resist these negative pressures grows smaller. (Page 6)
- Sometimes specialized knowledge (knowledge of the part) can get in the way of understanding the whole. (Page 7)
- the context of the patient’s complaints about himself and his associates and his mode of psychological adaption have been provided by the larger society. (Page 7)
- a neurosis is simultaneously a “sociosis” (a disorder of society). (Page 7)
- I regard social character as a mode of conformity. (Page 9)
- Whereas each personality, or total self, is unique, social character, cutting across social divisions, is more or less universal in a society. Social character is the cultural form of personality. (Page 9)
- The aesthetical has to do with how things impact our senses. (Page 9)
- The ethical is concerned with requirements and limits in our relationships to others. (Page 9)
- Art sometimes takes moral issues as a theme, just as morality can become aestheticized so that the pursuit of pleasure (consumption today) becomes a requirement. (Page 10)
- When one is not ethically bound to others, one is free to relate to them as if in a game, attempting to gain advantage. (Page 10)
- With the movement to the ethical existence-sphere, one assumes responsibility to others and oneself. (Page 10)
- there is no unity in pleasure. Instead, there is self-abandonment as one merges with the object of pleasure. Therefore, an aesthetical approach to life entails a multiplicity of selves--a different self in each situation. (Page 10)
    - Note: note: not saying this is how it _should_ be, but how it is in the situation.
- Sincerity as it applied to humans (objects at one time could be called "sincere") originally referred to an individual who consistently practiced virtue. But no sooner was it applied to human relationships than it was applied to society as a whole. Hence a sincere society was one in which the actual conduct of the citizens more or less corresponded to the stated morality and one in which society actually encouraged the sincerity of its citizens. (Page 11)
- To know whether or to what extent society hindered or assisted the sincerity of its citizens required critical judgment about society. (Page 11)
- art either helps form public opinion or creates subcultures of its own. (Page 11)
- Rousseau may have fathered modernity, but it became a disobedient child. (Page 11)
- The nineteenth century was the scene of the great reversal: the aesthetical dimension of culture became more important than the ethical dimension. (Page 11)
- Being true to virtue is less important than being true to one's emotions. [in the 19th century] (Page 11)
- If the British view themselves through the concept of sincerity into the nineteenth century, Americans perceived themselves in terms of the concept of character. (Page 12)
- It was not until the early twentieth century in America that the term _personality_ began to supplant _character_; it was largely aesthetic conception of the self. The self that was redefined in terms of self-expression, self-fulfillment, and performance was a personality. (Page 13)
- Manners, for instance, were not so much about virtuous action as about the impact of action on others: pleasure and influence. (Page 13)
- The historical change from character to personality parallels that from sincerity to authenticity. (Page 13)
- three types of social character that have existed throughout history: tradition-directed, inner-directed, and other-directed. (Page 13)
- Traditions in the form of rituals and mythical beliefs take precedence over individual rationality. For our purposes the critical issue is that there is no full sense of individuality present so that members of society are similar in most important respects. This character type is moral in that the sacred traditions that form the basis for conformity are ethical in nature. The chief psychological control in this type of society is shame. (Page 13)
- This social character type [inner-directed] has two major aspects: the internalization of moral values (a conscience) and clearly articulated goals, often economic. The inner-directed person is "driven" to achieve his goals, but his conscience limits both the goals and the means by which they are achieved. The inner-directed individual internalizes goals and normative attitudes that family, teachers, and religious leaders have established for him....The paramount form of psychological control is guilt; the inner-directed type experiences guilt even when no one is around to shame him. (Page 13)
- the other-directed type is aesthetical in orientation; it is primarily concerned, at the beginning of the twenty-first century, with consumption. The dominant mode of conformity is adjustment to the peer group, which in Riesman's felicitous phrase is a "tutor in consumption."....Riesman refers to peer group members as "antagonistic cooperators," who are competing for popularity, friendship, and at times leadership. Psychological control is based on diffuse anxiety: one is never sure where one stands with others. (Page 14)
- The most important product today, Riesman argues, is a personality. Like all other products it must be highly differentiated, if only in superficial ways. Consumption extends to everything from politics to personality: we become connoisseurs and consumers of the personalities of others. (Page 14)
