## Highlights
- Another way to put it is that mindfulness, as Mark Williams and Danny Penman point out, is actually a practice. It is a way of being, rather than merely a good idea or a clever technique, or a passing fad. ([Location 50](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005NJ2T1G&location=50))
- because it is a practice rather than merely a good idea, its cultivation is a process, one that of necessity unfolds and deepens over time. ([Location 55](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005NJ2T1G&location=55))
- This architecture is strongly evidence-based, arising out of the curricula of mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) and mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT), and fashioned into a coherent, compelling and commonsensical eight-week program for anyone caring about his or her own health and sanity, especially in this increasingly fast-paced and, as they refer to it, frantic world. ([Location 64](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005NJ2T1G&location=64))
- mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) ([Location 110](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005NJ2T1G&location=110))
- it can also prevent normal feelings of anxiety, stress and sadness from spiraling downwards into prolonged periods of unhappiness and exhaustion—or even serious clinical depression. ([Location 117](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005NJ2T1G&location=117))
- You come to the profound understanding that thoughts and feelings (including negative ones) are transient. They come and they go, and ultimately, you have a choice about whether to act on them or not. ([Location 123](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005NJ2T1G&location=123))
- Mindfulness is about observation without criticism; ([Location 124](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005NJ2T1G&location=124))
- mindfulness allows you to catch negative thought patterns before they tip you into a downward spiral. ([Location 126](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005NJ2T1G&location=126))
- Scientific studies have shown that mindfulness not only prevents depression, but that it also positively affects the brain patterns underlying day-to-day anxiety, stress, depression and irritability so that when they arise, they dissolve away again more easily. ([Location 128](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005NJ2T1G&location=128))
- Meditation helps cultivate a deep and compassionate awareness that allows you to assess your goals and find the optimum path towards realizing your deepest values. ([Location 145](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005NJ2T1G&location=145))
- Our moods naturally wax and wane. It’s the way we’re meant to be. But certain patterns of thinking can turn a short-term dip in vitality or emotional well-being into longer periods of anxiety, stress, unhappiness and exhaustion. ([Location 177](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005NJ2T1G&location=177))
- it’s not the mood that does the damage but how you react to it. ([Location 182](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005NJ2T1G&location=182))

- The mind is constantly trawling through memories to find those that echo our current emotional state. ([Location 193](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005NJ2T1G&location=193))
- Many judgmental and self-critical thoughts arise out of habitual ways of thinking and acting. ([Location 241](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005NJ2T1G&location=241))
- just the act of smiling can make you happy (even if it’s forced); ([Location 337](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005NJ2T1G&location=337))
- minor bodily sensations sometimes seemed to feed back on themselves to tip him into an emotional spiral. ([Location 349](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005NJ2T1G&location=349))
- we rarely experience tension or sadness on their own—anger, irritability, bitterness, jealousy and hatred can all be bound up with them in an uncomfortable, spiky knot of pain. ([Location 377](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005NJ2T1G&location=377))
- The result is that the brain’s alarm signals start to be triggered not only by the current scare, but by past threats and future worries. ([Location 403](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005NJ2T1G&location=403))
- New evidence from brain scans confirms this: people who spend their days rushing around mindlessly, who find it difficult to stay present and get so focused on goals that they lose touch with the outside world, have an amygdala (the primeval part of the brain involved in fight-or-flight) that is on “high alert” all the time. ([Location 404](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005NJ2T1G&location=404))
- the way we react can transform temporary and non-problematic emotions into persistent and troublesome ones. ([Location 409](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005NJ2T1G&location=409))
- When we’re unhappy, for example, it’s natural to try to figure out why we’re feeling this way and to find a way of solving the problem of unhappiness. But tension, unhappiness or exhaustion aren’t “problems” that can be solved. They are emotions. They reflect states of mind and body. As such, they cannot be solved—only felt. Once you’ve felt them—that is, acknowledged their existence—and let go of the tendency to explain or get rid of them, they are much more likely to vanish naturally, ([Location 418](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005NJ2T1G&location=418))

- People genuinely believe that if they worry enough over their unhappiness they will eventually find a solution. ([Location 450](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005NJ2T1G&location=450))
- But research shows the opposite: in fact, brooding reduces our ability to solve problems; and it’s absolutely hopeless for dealing with emotional difficulties. ([Location 451](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005NJ2T1G&location=451))
- You can’t stop the triggering of unhappy memories, negative self-talk and judgmental ways of thinking—but what you can stop is what happens next. You can stop the vicious circle from feeding off itself and triggering the next spiral of negative thoughts. ([Location 455](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005NJ2T1G&location=455))
### CHAPTER THREE Waking Up to the life You Have
- Our minds also have a different way of relating to the world—it’s called the Being mode. It’s akin to—but far more than—a shift in perspective. ([Location 512](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005NJ2T1G&location=512))
    - Tags: [[definition]] 
- Doing mode is not an enemy to be defeated, but is often an ally. Doing mode only becomes a “problem” when it volunteers for a task that it cannot do, such as “solving” a troubling emotion. When this happens, it pays to “shift gear” into “Being” mode. This is what mindfulness gives us: the ability to shift gears as we need to, rather than being permanently stuck in the same one. ([Location 530](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005NJ2T1G&location=530))
- When you become more mindful, you bring your intentions and actions back into alignment, rather than being constantly sidetracked by your autopilot. ([Location 565](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005NJ2T1G&location=565))
- This is the very foundation of mindful awareness: waking up to what’s happening inside of you, and in the world, moment by moment. ([Location 579](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005NJ2T1G&location=579))
- The Doing mode involves judging and comparing the “real” world with the world as we’d like it to be in our thoughts and dreams. ([Location 580](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005NJ2T1G&location=580))
- Being mode, on the other hand, invites you temporarily to suspend judgment. ([Location 583](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005NJ2T1G&location=583))
- mindfulness allows you, simply and compassionately, to observe it rather than judge it, attack it, argue with it or try to disprove its validity. ([Location 587](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005NJ2T1G&location=587))
- Doing mode solves problems not only by bearing in mind your goals and destinations, but also by holding on to “anti-goals” and the places you don’t want to go to. ([Location 604](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005NJ2T1G&location=604))
- Being mode, on the other hand, encourages you to “approach” the very things that you feel like avoiding; it invites you to take a friendly interest in your most difficult states of mind. ([Location 611](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005NJ2T1G&location=611))
- Both your memory and your ability to plan for the future are critical to the smooth running of your daily life, but they are also biased by your prevailing moods. ([Location 616](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005NJ2T1G&location=616))
- You can still remember the past and plan for the future, but Being mode allows you to see them for what they are. You see memory as memory and planning as planning. Consciously knowing that you are remembering, and knowing that you are planning, helps free you from being a slave to mental time travel. You are able to avoid the extra pain that comes through re-living the past and pre-living the future. ([Location 624](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005NJ2T1G&location=624))
- Being mode restores the balance by helping you sense more clearly the things that nourish you and those that deplete your inner resources. ([Location 633](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005NJ2T1G&location=633))
- mindful acceptance is not resignation. ([Location 654](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005NJ2T1G&location=654))
- One of the most astonishing features of mindfulness meditation is that you can see its profoundly positive effects actually changing the brain. ([Location 662](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005NJ2T1G&location=662))
- Research has shown that committing yourself to daily practice over a period of eight weeks is sufficient for you to see the benefits for yourself. ([Location 667](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005NJ2T1G&location=667))
- Mindfulness has been found to boost resilience—that is, the ability to withstand life’s knocks and setbacks—to quite a remarkable degree. ([Location 758](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005NJ2T1G&location=758))
- So “hardy” people have a belief that their situation has inherent meaning that they can commit themselves to, that they can manage their life and that their situation is understandable—that it is basically comprehensible, even if it seems chaotic and out of control. ([Location 766](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005NJ2T1G&location=766))
#### The Chocolate meditation Choose some chocolate—either a type that you’ve never tried before or one that you have not eaten recently. It might be dark and flavorsome, organic or fair-trade or whatever you choose. The important thing is to choose a type you wouldn’t normally eat or that you consume only rarely. Here goes: Open the packet. Inhale the aroma. Let it sweep over you. Break off a piece and look at it. Really let your eyes drink in what it looks like, examining every nook and cranny. Pop it in your mouth. See if it’s possible to hold it on your tongue and let it melt, noticing any tendency to suck at it. Chocolate has over three hundred different flavors. See if you can sense some of them. If you notice your mind wandering while you do this, simply notice where it went, then gently escort it back to the present moment. After the chocolate has completely melted, swallow it very slowly and deliberately. Let it trickle down your throat. Repeat this with the next piece. How do you feel? Is it different from normal? Did the chocolate taste better than if you’d just eaten it at a normal breakneck pace?
- Habit Releasers snap you out of a rut and can give you new avenues of life to explore. ([Location 807](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005NJ2T1G&location=807))
- The Body Scan meditation helps to train your mind so that you can focus your attention directly on your bodily sensations without judging or analyzing what you find. ([Location 836](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005NJ2T1G&location=836))
- Many of life’s problems can be left to resolve themselves, but some need to be faced with a spirit of openness, curiosity and compassion. ([Location 852](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005NJ2T1G&location=852))
- They exploit another understanding that you’ll gain from meditation—that it’s difficult to be curious and unhappy at the same time. ([Location 868](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005NJ2T1G&location=868))
- In much of our lives, if we do not like something, we are tempted to rush on to something else, but this program is suggesting a different approach: to use your restless and churning mind as an opportunity to look more deeply into it, rather than as an immediate reason to conclude that the meditation is “not working.” ([Location 875](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005NJ2T1G&location=875))
- If you still feel that meditation will take up too much time, then try it as an experiment to see if you discover what others have reported—that it frees up more time than it uses—so that you find you are unexpectedly rewarded with more free time. ([Location 886](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005NJ2T1G&location=886))
- Apparent “failures” are where you will learn the most. ([Location 907](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005NJ2T1G&location=907))
### CHAPTER FIVE Mindfulness Week One: Waking Up to the Autopilot
- In the short term, the automatic pilot allows us to extend the working memory by creating habits. If we repeat something more than a couple of times, the mind links together all of the actions needed to complete a task in a brilliantly seamless manner. ([Location 965](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005NJ2T1G&location=965))
- Habits trigger thoughts, which trigger more thoughts, which end up triggering yet more habitual thoughts. ([Location 980](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005NJ2T1G&location=980))
- The first stage of regaining your innate mindfulness involves returning to basics. You need to relearn how to focus your awareness on one thing at a time. ([Location 994](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005NJ2T1G&location=994))
#### Mindfulness and your autopilot
#### The Raisin meditation2 Set aside five to ten minutes when you can be alone, in a place, and at a time, when you will not be disturbed by the phone, family or friends. Switch off your cell phone, so it doesn’t play on your mind. You will need a few raisins (or other dried fruit or small nuts). You’ll also need a piece of paper and a pen to record your reactions afterward. Your task will be to eat the fruit or nuts in a mindful way, much as you ate the chocolate earlier. Read the instructions below to get an idea of what’s required, and only reread them if you really need to. The spirit in which you do the meditation is more important than covering every instruction in minute detail. You should spend about twenty to thirty seconds on each of the following eight stages: 1. Holding Take one of the raisins (or your choice of dried fruit or nuts) and hold it in the palm of your hand, or between your fingers and thumb. Focusing on it, approach it as if you have never seen anything like it before. Can you feel the weight of it in your hand? Is it casting a shadow on your palm? 2. Seeing Take the time really to see the raisin. Imagine you have never seen one before. Look at it with great care and full attention. Let your eyes explore every part of it. Examine the highlights where the light shines; the darker hollows, the folds and ridges. 3. Touching Turn the raisin over between your fingers, exploring its texture. How does it feel between the forefinger and thumb of the other hand? 4. Smelling Now, holding it beneath your nose, see what you notice with each in-breath. Does it have a scent? Let it fill your awareness. And if there is no scent, or very little, notice this as well. 5. Placing Slowly take the object to your mouth and notice how your hand and arm know exactly where to put it. And then gently place it in your mouth, noticing what the tongue does to “receive” it. Without chewing, simply explore the sensations of having it on your tongue. Gradually begin to explore the object with your tongue, continuing for thirty seconds or more if you choose. 6. Chewing When you’re ready, consciously take a bite into the raisin and notice the effects on the object, and in your mouth. Notice any tastes that it releases. Feel the texture as your teeth bite into it. Continue slowly chewing it, but do not swallow it just yet. Notice what is happening in the mouth. 7. Swallowing See if you can detect the first intention to swallow as it arises in your mind, experiencing it with full awareness before you actually swallow. Notice what the tongue does to prepare it for swallowing. See if you can follow the sensations of swallowing the raisin. If you can, consciously sense it as it moves down into your stomach. And if you don’t swallow it all at one time, consciously notice a second or even a third swallow, until it has all gone. Notice what the tongue does after you have swallowed. 8. Aftereffects Finally, spend a few moments registering the aftermath of this eating…
- You only ever have a moment to live, this moment, and yet we all tend to live in the past or in the future. ([Location 1058](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005NJ2T1G&location=1058))
- Gradually, you will come to see that turning toward the chatter of the mind—becoming fully aware of it—grants you more choices and greater room for maneuver. ([Location 1075](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005NJ2T1G&location=1075))
- tuning into the breath can be an important antidote to the natural tendency toward believing that we have to be in control. ([Location 1110](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005NJ2T1G&location=1110))
- the breath can be a sensitive monitor for your feelings. ([Location 1114](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005NJ2T1G&location=1114))
- meditation ultimately liberates more time than it uses. ([Location 1125](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005NJ2T1G&location=1125))
#### Mindfulness of the Body and Breath This is a short body and breath meditation designed to settle and ground yourself in the present moment. Start by finding a comfortable position. Either lie on a mat or a thick rug, or sit on a firm, straight-backed chair, a cushion or a meditation stool. If you’re sitting on a chair, allow your feet to be flat on the floor with your legs uncrossed and your spine straight, so that your posture supports your intention to be awake and aware. In this way, the posture is dignified but comfortable—not stiff or tensed up. If you are lying down, allow your legs to be uncrossed, with your feet falling away from each other, and your arms lying alongside and slightly away from your body. Now allow your eyes to close, if that feels comfortable, or lower your gaze. Bring your awareness to the sensations where the body is in contact with whatever you are sitting or lying on. Spend a few moments exploring these sensations. At a certain point, gather your attention and move it to focus on your feet, so that the “spotlight of attention” takes in the toes, the soles of the feet, the heels, the top of the feet and the ankles. Attend to any and all of the physical sensations you can be aware of in your feet and ankles, moment by moment. Notice how sensations arise and dissolve in awareness. If there are no sensations, simply register a blank. This is perfectly fine—we are not trying to make sensations happen—we are simply registering what is already here when we attend. Now expand your attention to take in the lower legs, the knees, then the rest of your legs. Hold both legs “center-stage” in awareness—notice whatever physical sensations there may be here in the legs. Expand your attention up the body to the pelvis and hips, the lower back and the lower abdomen. Move up the torso to include the chest and the back—right up to the shoulders—noticing all the physical sensations in the torso. Expand your attention again to include the left arm; then the right arm; then the neck and the face and head, until you are holding the whole body in awareness. See if it is possible to allow the whole body and its sensations to be just as they are. There’s no need to try to control anything. As best you can, allow sensations to be just as you find them. At a certain point, bring your awareness to the center of the body—to the sensations in the abdomen as the breath moves in and out of the body. Become fully aware of the changing patterns of physical sensations in this region of the body. If you like, you can place your hand here for a few breaths and feel the abdomen rising and falling. There may be mild sensations of stretching as the abdomen gently rises with each in-breath, and there may be different sensations as the abdomen falls with each out-breath. For the full duration of each in-breath and the full duration of each out-breath, be fully alive to the sensations of breathing. There is no need to try to control the breath in any way at…
