### FOREWORD  THE CHALLENGE TO FIND THE CAUSE AND CURE OF OBESITY: THREE VIEWPOINTSS
- Interestingly, he found that you could be underweight and have an elevated uric acid level and a remark-remarkable risk for obesity, high blood pressure, and fatty liver and meta- bolic syndrome. ([Location 142](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=142))
- Along similar lines there is another enzyme that a number of animals lack but humans have and that is called fructokinase. There are genetic disorders in humans in which they actually lack this enzyme and it turns out that these individuals don’t become fat. ([Location 155](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=155))
### PREFACE IN SEARCH OF THE THRIFTY GENE
- Unfortunately, the story of Nauru is not new in history. Dramatic increases in obesity and diabetes have been seen with the introduction of western culture time and time again. Examples include the Native American Indians, the Maori of New Zealand, and the Australian Aborigines. It is also not peculiar to indigenous peoples. Today obesity is occurring in all peoples, especially among the young. It does not matter whether you live in Tibet, Mongolia, or the Amazon. Wherever western culture is being introduced, obesity and diabetes are increasing. ([Location 294](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=294))
- We show that the process of storing fat and becoming insulin resistant is not peculiar to humans, but something all animals have learned to do to help them survive. More importantly, most animals have developed ways to become obese like clockwork, often to prepare them for a period of time when they know food will not be available. Mammals and reptiles become fat prior to hibernation in winter, the lungfish becomes fat before burrowing in the mud to survive the droughts of summer, the whale gets fat prior to leaving the Arctic to mate in Baja, and many birds get fat prior to long distance migration. Even insects get fat prior to becoming a pupa and making a cocoon. Many of these animals not only become fat, but also become insulin resistant. However, the major difference between obesity among these animals and humans is that for animals in the wild, the obesity is temporary and highly regulated, and weight returns to normal once the migration is completed or the winter has subsided. In contrast, humans are getting fatter and fatter, in an apparently unregulated, out of the control way. ([Location 316](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=316))
- In other words, western culture is responding to our body needs from activating the switch, and not the reverse. ([Location 332](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=332))
- In this book we will show that the primary means for activating this pathway is from the intake of sugar, and to a lesser extent from other foods such as beer. ([Location 337](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=337))
- uric acid may also have an important role in causing high blood pressure and amplifies the effects of sugar to stimulate fat accumulation. ([Location 341](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=341))
### PROLOGUE THE GREATEST EPIDEMIC IN HISTORY
- Obesity also increases the risk for other diseases, such as type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, fatty liver disease, stroke, and heart disease. Obesity is also associated with increased risk for cancers, including breast, colon, prostate, endometrial, kidney and gall bladder cancer. ([Location 410](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=410))
### SECTION 1 WHY OBESITY WAS ONCE GOOD
#### CHAPTER 1 SURVIVAL OF THE FATTEST
- For animals, the principal form of energy stored is fat, which is converted to energy if there is not enough food provided in the diet. All animals have learned how to store fat, whether it is a hibernating bear, a whale, a migrating bird, or even an insect preparing for metamorphosis into a pupa. ([Location 445](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=445))
- An extremely important aspect is that the increase in fat that many animals undergo is not only scheduled, but also tightly regulated. ([Location 456](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=456))
- Perhaps more interestingly, animals that have shifted into a fasting mode often reject food even if it is available. ([Location 471](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=471))
#### CHAPTER 2 THE BENEFITS OF BEING FAT
- Most animals store fat similar to humans, collecting it in specific fat cells (adipocytes) that are present in the subcutaneous regions of the skin and in the abdomen. Animals, especially birds, also store much fat in their liver. ... Many animals also store fat in their blood in the form of triglycerides. ([Location 511](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=511))
- the larger an animal is, the more fat it can store relative to its energy needs.18 This is because energy needs relate more to the body surface area whereas energy stores relate more to body volume, and as we increase in size, the body volume increases more than the surface area. ([Location 550](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=550))
- compared to a warm blooded mammal, a cold blooded reptile uses twelve times less energy. ([Location 583](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=583))
- Hibernation does not require the presence of winter. In some places in the world, it may occur when temperatures become extremely hot (summer hibernation, also known as estivation). ([Location 611](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=611))
    - Tags: [[definition]] 
#### CHAPTER 3 IF FAT IS GOOD, WHY ARE WE BECOMING DIABETIC?
- Insulin resistance turns out to be a key survival strategy for animals, similar to the importance of storing fat. ([Location 656](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=656))
- Since the glucose and fat are so rapidly utilized, the hummingbird never develops evidence for diabetic complications. ([Location 674](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=674))
- Since insulin is critical for driving glucose into the cell, then how does glucose in the blood help an animal to survive if it is insulin resistant? The answer is that not all organs are resistant to insulin. In particular, the brain does not require insulin for the uptake of glucose. ... However, when an animal fasts for a long time, other ways take over to provide energy to the brain. ([Location 685](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=685))
#### CHAPTER 4 FAT, HIBERNATION, AND BEAUTY
- true hibernation is associated with profound reductions in metabolism (rates to 1 to 5 percent of their basal metabolism) that cannot sustain pregnancy in which a fetus is actively growing. As a consequence, only small mammals (17 pounds or lower) that can wait to become pregnant in spring can be true hibernators. ([Location 708](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=708))
- Pregnant women may need even better nutrition than most animals, as humans are one of the only species in which the baby is born with relatively high amounts of fat. ([Location 746](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=746))
- To summarize, an overriding principle of evolution is to develop ways to survive periods when food is not available. One of the best ways to do this is to become fat and insulin resistant and also reduce energy needs. Having fat stores is especially important for the mother to assure a healthy baby. This led to early humans viewing obesity as both desirable and representative of fertility. ([Location 790](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=790))
#### CHAPTER 5 IS HUMAN OBESITY REGULATED?
- Obesity results not because we choose to eat larger portions or to exercise less. Rather we have activated a “program” to become fat. This causes increased appetite, resulting in more food intake, and decreased energy output, resulting in exercising less. The equation is the same. Too much food intake plus too little exercise equals Fat. However, the interpretation is different. Obesity is not from gluttony and idleness, but rather because we have activated the same program all animals use to increase fat stores. ([Location 799](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=799))
- Leptin is a protein released into the blood from fat tissues following eating and acts as a satiety signal to the brain. ([Location 873](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=873))
- Ghrelin has some functions which act oppositely to leptin, for when it turns on, it signals to eat; hence it is sometimes referred to as the hunger hormone. ([Location 877](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=877))
- Together, ghrelin, leptin and insulin help control our appetite. It is actually difficult to make an animal fat if these hormonal systems are operating normally, although they can be overruled if the animal decides to do so. ([Location 878](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=878))
- Just as obesity is associated with “insulin resistance,” obese persons often become resistant to the effects of leptin. Since leptin does not effectively signal satiety in response to food, leptin levels rise to compensate, just like insulin levels rise in response to insulin resistance. ([Location 880](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=880))
- The body generates energy by making ATP (adenosine triphosphate), primarily from carbohydrates and fats. ([Location 898](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=898))
- The oxidation or “burning” of fatty acids from fat is very effective at generating ATP. This process occurs in the mitochondria, which are small structures that exist inside the normal cell. Mitochondria also generate ATP from products of glucose metabolism, although this is not as efficient in producing ATP as from fat. ATP then drives metabolism by its ability to donate phosphate groups, and thus can keep the cell healthy and active. ([Location 901](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=901))
- Obese people have a defect in their ability to burn fat.69-71 This defect is also found in individuals predisposed to obesity.72 The defect is associated with a reduction in mitochondria in skeletal muscle as well as the peripheral white blood cells.73-75 ATP levels are also low in the liver.76 ([Location 904](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=904))
- Obesity is therefore triggered by an alteration in metabolism, in which leptin resistance results in increased food intake, and a block in energy production leads to preferential conversion of the energy into fat. ([Location 918](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=918))
### SECTION 2 IDENTIFICATION OF THE SWITCH THAT CAUSES OBESITY
#### CHAPTER 6 A DETECTIVE'S APROACH TO FINDING THE "FAT SWITCH"
- When one undergoes starvation, one first burns off excess carbohydrate stores, then the fat stores, and finally the animal starts to degrade the protein stores in the muscle. ([Location 951](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=951))
- When food is removed from an animal, the immediate response is to maintain the blood glucose level to assure sufficient nutrition for the brain. As blood glucose levels start to fall, the body responds by reducing its level of insulin, and the glycogen in the liver starts to break down rapidly, releasing glucose into the circulation that can provide the needed energy to the brain and other tissues. ([Location 962](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=962))
- The breakdown of glycogen is the “rapid response” to food shortage. ... In humans it can happen within hours if a person is exercising, and in about 12 hours if one is not.3-5 ([Location 967](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=967))
    - Tags: [[health]] 
- The important point to remember is that it is hard to burn fat when one has glycogen stores in the liver. ([Location 975](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=975))
- Phase 1 is activated daily, as it is the principal mechanism for providing energy between meals. In contrast, phase 2 is designed to provide energy for prolonged periods of time when food is unavailable. Hence, this is the “professional” phase of starvation, for this is exactly what the animal has planned. The phase usually begins around 24 hours and is characterized by the burning of fat. ([Location 978](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=978))
- Since the burning of fat does not generate glucose, the supply of glucose to the brain must come from another source. Initially this is from muscle breakdown, which releases amino acids from the muscle protein that can be used to make glucose through a chemical process (called gluconeogenesis). However, after a few weeks the brain switches its metabolism from using glucose as its fuel to ketoacids which are generated from the burning of fat. This allows the preservation of the muscle mass. ([Location 987](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=987))
- No animal wants to enter phase 3, for this is when the fat stores have been depleted. ([Location 1000](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=1000))
- Once carbohydrate and fat stores are depleted, the animal degrades its protein (muscle) for survival. The animal is now desperate, and must activate processes to maximally help the animal obtain food and regain weight. This is called “the foraging response.” ([Location 1007](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=1007))
- If an animal would ever desire to activate a metabolic process to gain weight, it would be during the foraging response. In this regard, one of the most characteristic findings that occurs during this phase is a sudden rise in serum cortisol. ([Location 1018](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=1018))
- Cortisol is critical in animals during phase 3 starvation for if the adrenal glands are removed, then the breakdown of protein is blocked, and the subsequent generation of energy needed for survival is reduced.13 The steroids also have a role in awakening the animal and increasing its activity so that it can find food. ([Location 1021](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=1021))
- The other major characteristic of the foraging response is a rise in serum uric acid. As starvation progresses, muscle cells break down their proteins into amino acids that are released to provide energy. Two important amino acids that are released are glutamine and glutamate, both which have important roles in the synthesis of uric acid. Muscle breakdown also is associated with some release of DNA and RNA from the cells. DNA and RNA are nucleic acids and they become degraded. One of the major products of this degradation process is uric acid. The consequence of these events is that there is a marked rise in uric acid in the blood. ([Location 1024](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=1024))
- A rise in serum cortisol and uric acid appear to be the two striking changes that occur when fat stores become depleted, and both correlate with the awakening of the animal and its immediate search for food (“foraging response”). ([Location 1063](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=1063))
    - Tags: [[definition]] 
- Cortisol is a steroid released from the adrenal glands in periods of stress. It has numerous effects that suggest it is an alarm signal. It suppresses sleep, raises blood pressure and causes retention of salt and water, all features that help an animal survive when food, water and salt supplies are low. ([Location 1067](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=1067))
- While cortisol would be considered a great candidate for driving the obesity epidemic, serum cortisol levels are not high in the average obese person. ([Location 1074](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=1074))
- an elevated uric acid is also common in individuals with obesity and insulin resistance, ([Location 1079](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=1079))
- Even more striking, even if you are skinny and completely healthy, if you have an increased serum uric acid you have a remarkable risk for developing obesity, high blood pressure, fatty liver, and metabolic syndrome.24-28 In other words, an elevated uric acid is not only common in obesity, but it also precedes and predicts its development. ([Location 1081](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=1081))
#### CHAPTER 7 URIC ACID, AN "ENERGY CRISIS" SIGNAL THAT STIMULATES FAT ACCUMULATION
- drive all cell functions are under attack. Like ATP, uric acid likely represents a carryover from the RNA world and may have a survival role that is used by all living organisms. ([Location 1122](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=1122))
- Because uric acid has 4 nitrogen atoms per molecule, it is a more efficient way to rid nitrogen compared to urea (which has two nitrogens) and ammonia (which has one nitrogen). ([Location 1128](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=1128))
- Oxidative stress is a process in which substances that contain oxygen are altered so they are highly chemically reactive with tissues, thereby damaging them or altering their ability to function. ([Location 1149](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=1149))
    - Tags: [[definition]] 
- uric acid causes oxidative stress in the mitochondria, injuring specific enzymes involved in energy production, and at high concentrations actually reducing the total number of mitochondria in the cell. ([Location 1151](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=1151))
- The oxidative stress induced by the uric acid specifically inhibited an enzyme that led to citrate accumulation, which is a substance that stimulates fat production. Uric acid also inhibited an enzyme required for the burning of fatty acids, leading to less ATP being produced. The net effect was to stimulate fat synthesis, reduce the burning of fat, and reduce energy (ATP) output! In other words, uric acid had altered the mitochondrial energy factories to preferentially convert the energy from food into fat as opposed to producing ATP. ([Location 1153](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=1153))
- Lowering uric acid improves insulin resistance in laboratory animals, ([Location 1165](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=1165))
- Raising uric acid in laboratory animals results in increased blood pressure, especially under conditions in which dietary salt is limited. ([Location 1170](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=1170))
- Over time the rise in uric acid causes low grade injury to the kidney, resulting in the retention of salt (sodium) that further raises the blood pressure. ([Location 1174](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=1174))
- Thus a rise in uric acid would have great survival benefits by both raising blood pressure and increasing the blood pressure response to salt intake. These effects would protect the animal from a fall in blood pressure that could occur in the setting of dehydration or inadequate salt intake. ([Location 1175](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=1175))
- uric acid stimulates the release of inflammatory proteins from cells, including the well-known marker, C-reactive protein. ([Location 1179](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=1179))
- The rise in uric acid inside the cell is therefore a “call to arms” to stimulate local inflammation and the immune response to fight infection. ([Location 1187](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=1187))
- To conclude, uric acid should be viewed as a “mayday” signal by the animal under conditions of starvation or stress.74 Uric acid functions by acting on the mitochondria energy factories where it causes oxidative stress and disrupts energy metabolism. The result is an increase in fat accumulation, insulin resistance, a rise in blood pressure, the stimulation of inflammation and activation of the immune system. ([Location 1212](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=1212))
#### CHAPTER 8 TURNING THE OBESITY SWITCH ON AND OFF
- However, it is not the serum uric acid that causes fat accumulation, but rather the uric acid levels inside the cell, for we had found that the way uric acid causes fat accumulation is by causing oxidative stress to the mitochondria, and the latter are located inside the cell. Since one of the main sites where fat is both made and burned is the liver, our attention focused on this organ. ([Location 1247](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=1247))
- If AMP is metabolized by the enzyme, AMP deaminase, which we will call AMPD, the AMP is degraded, eventually producing uric acid. According to our data, the uric acid would then stimulate fat accumulation by both stimulating fat synthesis and blocking the degradation of fat. However, if AMP is engaged by the enzyme AMP kinase, or AMPK, an opposite effect occurs. Specifically, the activation of AMPK stimulates the utilization of fat by blocking fat synthesis and stimulating fatty acid oxidation. We therefore realized that AMP could sit at the fulcrum where it could be used to stimulate fat accumulation (via AMPD) or fat burning (via AMPK). ([Location 1255](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=1255))
- We should state right now that we do not know for certain whether the fat accumulation in squirrels is truly driven by the changes in these two enzymes, although the data is suggestive. We also do not know if this is a universal fat switch. ([Location 1270](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=1270))
- it is well known that people with obesity and diabetes have low AMPK activity. In fact, the number one drug used to treat diabetes is metformin, which works by inhibiting AMPD and stimulating AMPK.88 But if we have activated this switch, how could this have happened? ([Location 1280](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=1280))
#### CHAPTER 9 FRUCTOSE, A MASTER DRIVER OF THE FAT SWITCH
- To most observers, fructose and glucose might be considered similar. Both are “simple sugars” of approximately the same molecular weight, and both can be metabolized to produce glycogen and triglycerides. One distinct difference is that glucose is the primary sugar in the circulation and is regulated by insulin. However, as a food source they are commonly viewed as equivalent, as each sugar produces approximately 4 calories per gram. Nevertheless, numerous studies, especially in laboratory animals, have shown that fructose is much more effective at stimulating fat accumulation in the blood, liver, and fat tissues, as well causing insulin resistance when compared to glucose or starch (which consists of multiple glucose molecules). ([Location 1327](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=1327))
- Why would glucose and fructose be different in how they stimulate fat synthesis? When glucose is metabolized, the cell remains healthy and ATP levels increase. However, a unique feature of fructose is that there is a transient period of time during its metabolism when ATP levels plummet inside the cell. This paradoxical effect in which energy levels fall inside the cell with feeding of a nutrient is distinctly unusual. However, it occurs because the first enzyme in fructose metabolism, fructokinase, consumes ATP while it metabolizes fructose, and it does this as rapidly and uncontrollably as a runaway train. This process not only generates AMP but also activates AMPD, and intracellular uric acid accumulates. ([Location 1335](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=1335))
- In other words, if he blocked the activation of AMPD or the accumulation of intracellular uric acid the increase in fat was largely prevented, despite the fact that the fructose was still being metabolized. This provided strong evidence that it is not the calories from fructose that is causing the fat accumulation, but rather the activation of the AMPD fat switch. ([Location 1344](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=1344))
- We and others have found that fructose induces every feature of metabolic syndrome in rats, including visceral obesity, elevated serum triglycerides, low HDL cholesterol, elevated blood pressure, and insulin resistance. Fructose also stimulates increased food intake. ([Location 1349](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=1349))
- In addition to not stimulating leptin release in response to food, our group also found that rats fed fructose become leptin resistant. ([Location 1357](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=1357))
- Fructose is distinct from other foods in that it activates the fat switch that preferentially shunts the food we eat into fat. By activating the switch, obesity results from both an increase in food intake and a decrease in physical activity. The law of thermodynamics holds. However, unlike classical thinking, obesity occurring in response to fructose is not due to the animal choosing to eat too much or deciding to exercise too little. Rather, the switch is signaling the animal to eat too much and to exercise too little. ([Location 1361](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=1361))
#### CHAPTER 10 GENETIC REASONS WHY HUMANS ARE PRONE TO OBESITY
- Indeed, it was around 15 million years ago when a mutation occurred in ancestral humans that affects the way we metabolize uric acid. In most mammals, uric acid levels are low due to an enzyme, uricase, which degrades uric acid, eventually generating allantoin. However, humans and all great apes lost uricase due to a mutation, and as such humans and great apes have higher uric acid levels. ([Location 1415](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=1415))
- One of the consequences of not having uricase is that the uric acid response to fructose is markedly enhanced. ([Location 1418](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=1418))
- Vitamin C is an antioxidant and is made by most animals and plants. ([Location 1443](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=1443))
- There is a lot of indirect evidence to support opposing roles of fructose and vitamin C. For example, vitamin C can partially block the effects of fructose to induce metabolic syndrome in animals.131 Vitamin C also lowers serum uric acid levels and blocks mitochondrial oxidative stress.132-133 Vitamin C levels are also low in individuals with obesity and diabetes, and some studies suggest the administration of vitamin C can lower blood pressure and improve the oxidation (burning) of fat. Furthermore, as fruits ripen, fructose content increases whereas vitamin C levels decrease. In animals that make vitamin C, fructose inhibits vitamin C synthesis.134 Vitamin C is also high in the hibernating mammal during the winter when fat is being oxidized, but falls as the animal emerges from hibernation in association with rises in uric acid. ([Location 1454](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=1454))
    - Tags: [[health]] 
- Thus, all humans are double knockouts, meaning they lack two important genes. We lack uricase so we have higher uric acid levels. We lack the ability to make vitamin C so we tend to have lower levels of vitamin C than most animals. These mutations enhanced our ability to survive famine, and enhanced our ability to increase fat in response to our original major food source, fruit. However, as we moved from being a fruit-eating species to one that was a hunter-gatherer, and then to an agricultural society, we had a major surprise coming. A sweet surprise, one could say. For the discovery of sugarcane placed us in the perfect storm to become fat and diabetic. ([Location 1472](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=1472))
### SECTION 3 THE RISE OF SUGAR AND THE FATTENING OF MAN
#### CHAPTER 11 SUGAR FOR THE RICH
- Of interest, low levels of lead poisoning also increase uric acid levels, thereby activating the same pathways as fructose in causing obesity and diabetes. ([Location 1543](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=1543))
- The increased intake of sugar, and of sugared-alcohol drinks, is likely why so many kings became obese (the “Adipose Rex” syndrome). ([Location 1609](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=1609))
#### CHAPTER 12 SUGAR FOR THE POOR
- In fact, low levels of lead have been associated not only with gout, but also with obesity, elevated blood pressure, insulin resistance, and kidney disease.36-38 In a later chapter we will discuss the role of subtle lead poisoning in the epidemic of obesity in more detail.

#### CHAPTER 13 FRUCTOSE AND URIC ACID AND THEIR ROLE IN CAUSING OBESITY AND DIABETES
- Based on the experimental studies we presented earlier, we are becoming obese because we are eating too much and exercising too little, but the driving force is not because we are choosing to eat too much, but rather because our body is asking us to eat more. ([Location 1969](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=1969))
- As mentioned, when we block uricase, only low doses of fructose are necessary to induce insulin resistance, elevated blood pressure, and elevated serum triglycerides. ([Location 2009](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=2009))
- we have identified a scientific mechanism by which fructose causes metabolic syndrome. Specifically, we found that fructose increases uric acid in the cell that then alters the mitochondria to preferentially shunt the energy from food into fat. The mitochondrial oxidative stress also has a role in causing insulin resistance and hypertension.113 Fructose also causes leptin resistance, and blocks ATP production. ([Location 2011](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=2011))
- One of the best studies was done by Kimberly Stanhope and Peter Havel from the University of California, Davis. They took overweight men and women and provided meals in which 25 per cent of the calories were from glucose or 25 percent from fructose. Individuals took these meals for 10 weeks. Fat accumulation was measured at the beginning and end of the study using special X-rays (computerized tomography or CT scanning). In those individuals that ate a fructose-enriched diet, there was a significant increase in visceral fat compared to those given a glucose-based diet.115 The fructose fed individuals also developed worse insulin resistance and higher serum triglycerides following their meals. ([Location 2016](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=2016))
- Thus, fructose increases weight by encouraging food intake, by increasing the appetite and blocking the sensation of fullness. ([Location 2043](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=2043))
    - Tags: [[health]] 
- It is known that when we are young that we do not absorb fructose very well.126 The reason is that fructose is absorbed in the intestines through a special “transporter” and this is normally expressed at low levels. However, we and others have shown that the more an animal is exposed to sugar, the more it will increase the expression of this transporter.117,127-129 ([Location 2059](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=2059))
- Animals use fruits to increase their fat stores by waiting until the fruit is very ripe or by gorging on as many fruit as possible. One reason for waiting until fruit is ripe is that it increases the amount of fructose and decreases the vitamin C levels.130 However, the fruits we typically eat are not mushy ripe fruits but rather are more tart and contain less fructose and have high contents of vitamin C, antioxidants, potassium and fiber. As a consequence, high intake of fruits in humans is associated with a reduced frequency of diabetes. ([Location 2073](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=2073))
    - Tags: [[health]] 
- These studies suggest that the benefits of vitamin C and other substances in fruits likely outweigh the negative effects of fructose. However, it should be emphasized that the ingestion of large amounts of fruits, especially for those fruits low in vitamin C, is not recommended. Dried fruits, for example, contain high concentrations of fructose and have lost their vitamin C content. Fruit juices and punches are also problematic, for the rapid intake of juice could lead to significant elevations in the concentration of fructose in the liver, which is key for activating the metabolic switch. Drinking fruit juices is associated with an increased risk for obesity and diabetes, especially in children. ([Location 2082](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=2082))
- There is also some evidence that the biological effects of fructose are greater with HFCS compared to sucrose even if the total amount of fructose is kept equal. This is because the absorption of sucrose in the gut first requires that the sucrose be degraded by a gut enzyme, sucrase. Sucrase degrades sucrose to fructose and glucose that then are absorbed. This should result in a delay in absorption. In contrast, drinks containing HFCS already have the fructose and glucose available for immediate absorption. Hence, the fructose should be absorbed more rapidly, likely with higher peak concentrations. This might theoretically lead to worse fatty liver. ([Location 2111](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=2111))
    - Tags: [[health]] 
- While these studies suggest that HFCS may have greater effects than sucrose to cause fatty liver or obesity, it is important to emphasize that both sucrose and HFCS activate the switch to cause obesity and fatty liver. ([Location 2121](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=2121))
### SECTION 4 OTHER WAYS TO GET FAT
#### CHAPTER 14 BEER AND THE FRIAR TUCK SYNDROME
- Beer, like sugar, is very potent at raising uric acid levels, but this occurs over hours instead of minutes. ([Location 2211](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=2211))
- While alcohol can raise uric acid levels, the observation that alcohol-free beer raises uric acid to almost the same extent as regular beer shows that alcohol is not the cause.10 Rather, the primary way by which beer raises uric acid levels is due to the yeast content, which is rich in nucleic acids that stimulate the production of uric acid. __Brewer’s yeast has the highest RNA content of almost all foods__. Recall that RNA is a nucleotide which is metabolized to uric acid in the liver. While yeast is also used to make other types of alcohol, the yeast content in beer is particularly high, __especially in unfiltered beers__. ([Location 2215](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=2215))
- Beer is not simply a way humans get fat. The Japanese feed beer to Waygu cattle to make Kobe beef, a beef that is famous for its marbled fat and tenderness. The beer is given to the cattle to stimulate food intake and is given primarily during the summer months. Some cattle have been fed as many as 40 pints of beer a day to help them gain fat. ([Location 2233](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=2233))
- foods high in purines and nucleotides can raise uric acid and thus could theoretically activate the fat switch in the mitochondria and increase the risk for becoming obese. While the purine and nucleotide content of food can raise uric acid, uric acid can also be made from scratch by amino acids, particularly glycine and glutamine. A related amino acid, glutamate, can also rapidly increase the formation of uric acid and other nucleotide products in the liver of rats and chickens. ([Location 2246](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=2246))
- Perhaps not surprisingly, all foods high in purine content are also rich in umami since they contain nucleotide products such as IMP. Moreover, since glutamate also increases uric acid production in the liver, one can say with relative confidence that all umami foods would be expected to have a role in obesity and insulin resistance if enough is ingested. ([Location 2265](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=2265))
- The mechanism by which umami foods have been postulated to cause obesity has been attributed to its palatability, and possibly due to its ability to induce leptin resistance.20 However, we suggest that the effects are due to the ability of glutamates and IMP and related nucleotides to raise uric acid, thus activating the switch to induce leptin and insulin resistance and fat accumulation. ([Location 2277](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=2277))
- While these studies suggest that eating umami foods could be another cause of obesity, it is dwarfed by the effects of sugar. So please do not panic at this point. Nevertheless, for some people, the role of umami foods in causing insulin resistance and fat accumulation should not be underestimated. Currently the mean intake of glutamate is in the range of 550 to 580 mg daily in the United Kingdom and Japan, respectively, but some individuals may be eating as much as 4 to 10 grams of glutamate a day. ([Location 2312](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=2312))
- Furthermore, just as with fructose, individuals with high uric acid levels show a greater increase in uric acid levels in response to the administration of foods containing IMP. ([Location 2318](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=2318))
- Asians commonly have high uric acid levels, as well as high frequency of insulin resistance, diabetes and high blood pressure. While they show evidence of mild obesity with an increase in abdominal girth, they typically do not develop severe obesity. I believe this is because, as mentioned in earlier chapters, the increase in uric acid and other RNA products is important in triggering leptin resistance and setting the fat switch, but it is not the sugar or the umami foods that act as the primary fuel for weight gain. Rather, the strongest fuels for weight gain are foods high in fat content, which are less a part of the Asian diet as opposed to the American diet. ([Location 2322](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=2322))
#### CHAPTER 15 HIGH FAT DIET AND LIFE OF THE ESKIMO
- High fat diets provide a fuel for weight gain if the fat switch is turned on. However, if the fat switch is turned off, such as by a low carbohydrate diet, then diets high in fat and protein may result in weight loss. ([Location 2330](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=2330))
- One reason may relate to the type of fat ingested by the Inuit. This is because marine fats tend to be high in fish oils, which contain omega 3 fatty acids (including DHA (docosahexaenoic acid) and EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid)) that may help protect against atherosclerosis. Fats that contain omega 3 fatty acids appear to be safer than those that contain primarily omega 6 fatty acids, the latter which is especially concentrated in various oils from sunflower, corn, canola, and soybeans. ([Location 2412](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=2412))
- First, the absence of fructose in the diet may have helped turn off the fat switch and leptin resistance, thereby reducing appetite and increasing energy. Second, when there is minimal carbohydrate content in the diet, the glycogen stores in the liver rapidly become depleted, and this triggers the burning of fat, in association with a rise of ketones in the blood. Thus, the diet should act to reduce appetite, increase energy and stimulate the burning of fat. ([Location 2437](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=2437))
    - Tags: [[health]] 
- Nevertheless, most Inuit had mild vitamin C deficiency and this may have helped the Eskimo increase their fat stores. Some of the foods that the Inuit ate were also RNA-rich , such as the bone marrow of the caribou. This may also have helped increase their fat stores. ([Location 2449](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=2449))
- The Inuit also found ways to adapt to the cold environment. For example, cold stimulates brown fat,53 which generates more heat than regular fat when it is burned. The mitochondria of the Inuit and other American Indians have also been found to generate more heat when compared to other peoples. ([Location 2457](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=2457))
- High fat diets contribute to the obesity epidemic, primarily by acting as fuel once the fat switch has been turned on. Nevertheless, weight loss can be induced with high fat and high protein diets if carbohydrate intake is significantly reduced, as this latter move helps turn off the switch. ([Location 2470](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=2470))
    - Tags: [[health]] 
- Today the low carbohydrate, high fat diet is one of the most popular ways to lose weight. The knowledge of the fat switch should allow us, however, to develop better ways to lose weight that are safe and do not require having to make such drastic changes to the diet. ([Location 2474](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=2474))
#### CHAPTER 16 STARCH AND THE PILLSBURY DOUGHBOY SYNDROME
- The fat “Pillsbury Doughboy” as seen in the television ads has scientific basis! Some of us convert the starch we eat into fructose which is why starch can cause obesity. ([Location 2477](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=2477))
- However, there is a new twist to the story, as it now appears that there is another source of fructose which we had not considered before, and that is the stealth production of fructose generated during the metabolism of carbohydrates by the body. ([Location 2500](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=2500))
- While we knew that fructose can be made from glucose by a series of enzymes known as the polyol pathway, these enzymes were thought to be turned on only in diabetes. ([Location 2505](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=2505))
- If diabetic patients are given an “oral glucose tolerance test” in which they have to drink a bottle containing glucose water, there is not only a rise in glucose in the blood, but also a rise in fructose levels. ([Location 2507](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=2507))
- When we discovered that even normal animals are generating fructose from glucose in the diet via the polyol pathway, we wondered if the reason glucose water was causing obesity and fatty liver might be due to the glucose being converted to fructose in the body. In this regard, the polyol pathway can be stimulated by a number of ways, but one way is by incubating a cell with high levels of glucose. This, in fact, explains why diabetes is associated with high fructose levels in the blood. We realized that if one ingests foods that would increase glucose levels rapidly in the liver, then this might act as a stimulus for converting the glucose to fructose. ([Location 2522](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=2522))
- It is not just the fructose we eat, but the fructose we make, that makes us fat. ([Location 2537](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=2537))
- Gary Taubes also proposed in Good Calories, Bad Calories that obesity is driven primarily by intake of all carbohydrates, but had suggested that it was driven by insulin.67 Our studies would be consistent with Taube’s theory in that the mice lacking fructokinase still gained some weight when given glucose water. However, the major reason glucose causes obesity and fatty liver appears to be due to the conversion of glucose to fructose in the liver. So, in a way we were right in considering fructose as a primary nutrient driving obesity, but we were wrong in thinking you only get fructose from fructose-containing foods. ([Location 2538](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=2538))
    - Tags: [[health]] 
- An important question relates to the level of activity of the polyol pathway, for it will govern how much fructose is produced from the glucose provided by starches and other foods. ([Location 2543](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=2543))
- The reason artificial feeding (feeding by vein, or total parenteral nutrition) causes fatty liver is likely because the highly concentrated glucose solution is being converted to fructose. ([Location 2558](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=2558))
- The observation that increased concentrations of glucose can activate the polyol pathway and generate fructose could be relevant to the types of starches one eats. For example, certain foods raise blood glucose more effectively than others. These “high glycemic” foods include starchy foods such as breads and potatoes. It seems likely that these foods might be able to activate the polyol pathway more easily than more complex carbohydrates. ([Location 2560](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=2560))
- High glycemic foods, that is, foods that lead to a greater rise in glucose, may be more likely to generate fructose. ([Location 2567](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=2567))
- The generation of fructose by the polyol pathway may also be more likely in individuals with insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome, for these individuals will show a greater rise in glucose following meals than normal people. Individuals with metabolic syndrome also frequently have an elevated uric acid level, and Miguel Lanaspa found that uric acid stimulates the polyol pathway to make more fructose from glucose. This might explain why individuals with obesity or metabolic syndrome may find it harder to lose weight, for in these individuals the ingestion of carbohydrates generates more fructose than would be observed in a lean, healthy individual. ([Location 2569](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=2569))
- Starch causes obesity most easily in those who are insulin resistant, fat, or have high uric acid levels. ([Location 2574](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=2574))
- Intake of added sugars remains the major cause of the epidemic of obesity and metabolic syndrome, but it is not the only cause. Fructose can be generated other ways, including from simple carbohydrates. This latter way of becoming fat is most important when people are drinking liquids containing glucose (such as soft drinks and juices), when they have impaired glucose tolerance or diabetes (in which blood glucose levels are high), or when their serum uric acid is elevated. So there are at least two sources of fructose, one from the sugars we eat, and one from the fructose we make.

#### CHAPTER 17 STEALTH SOURCES OF FRUCTOSE AND URIC ACID
- There is a stealth source of fructose–which is the fructose generated by the bacteria in our gut. ([Location 2586](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=2586))
- Some bacteria are resourceful in that they can digest components of plants that we cannot, and in so doing they can produce foods inside our gut. One of the foods they produce is fructose. ([Location 2600](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=2600))
- In essence, fructans consist of multiple fructose molecules bound together. ([Location 2607](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=2607))
- As mentioned, plants and bacteria that make fructans have developed ways to convert the fructans back to fructose. They do this by producing enzymes called fructanases. Humans and other mammals do not have fructanases, so for us fructans are indigestible. However, this is not the case if we have bacteria in our gut that produce fructanases. ([Location 2620](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=2620))
- Fructans are polymers of fructose made by certain plants, particularly wheat. While humans cannot metabolize fructans, some gut bacteria can convert the fructans to fructose. This can be another source of fructose. ([Location 2631](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=2631))
- The primary sources of fructans in the human diet are wheat, rye, onions, artichokes, and green beans. ([Location 2632](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=2632))
- Indeed, the finding that obese people tend to carry fructan-degrading bacteria does not mean that the fructans are driving obesity, as these bacteria typically like fructose from sugar as well. ([Location 2635](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=2635))
- the ability of plants to make fructans as a way to store food began in the Miocene during the same period of global cooling in which the uricase mutation occurred among ancestral apes, and these early fructan producing plants mainly occurred in the northern latitudes such as Europe. ([Location 2637](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=2637))
- in one study the administration of the antibiotic streptomycin made larger and fatter chickens, whereas the use of penicillin made larger and leaner chickens.95 This is particularly interesting as streptomycin kills gram negative bacteria and hence would stimulate fructanase producing gram positive bacteria, whereas penicillin would be more likely reduce the fructanase-producing bacteria since this drugs mainly kills Streptococcus and gram positive bacteria. ([Location 2696](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=2696))
- Antibiotics promote growth and, in some case, fattening, of chickens, by altering the types of bacteria in the gut. ([Location 2700](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=2700))
- Perhaps not surprisingly, prebiotics tend to be spores of fructanase producing bacteria such as Bacillus subtilis, whereas probiotics are often fructans. However, what is interesting is that trials using these agents have tended to show that these agents increase lean mass and, if anything, protect from obesity, including in short term human trials. Why we are seeing this paradox is unknown. It may relate to the fact that individuals taking these substances are reducing their intake of added sugars, and in some of the studies the control groups were given sucrose. It is also possible that the administration of a probiotic, for example, acts more like fiber in the absence of bacteria that can degrade fructans. Clearly more studies are needed to understand this better. ([Location 2707](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=2707))
- Just as there are ways to take in fructose without knowing it, there are also stealth ways to raise uric acid. One of the more sinister ways may be from low grade exposure to lead. Lead increases serum uric acid by blocking its excretion by the kidney. It has therefore been known for over 100 years that lead poisoning can cause gout. However, the presence of lead in the blood, even at relatively low levels, has also been associated with increased risk for obesity, insulin resistance, chronic kidney disease and elevated blood pressure. ([Location 2714](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=2714))
- In our opinion, intake of fructose-containing sugars remains the major reason for the epidemic of obesity throughout the world, but it is not the only mechanism. Fructose can be generated other ways, including from fructans in the diet and also from simple carbohydrates. Uric acid can also be generated from other foods, such as from beer and umami foods, and also by low grade intoxication with lead. ([Location 2742](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=2742))
### SECTION 5 OTHER BIOLOGICAL EFFECTS OF FRUCTOSE AND URIC ACID
#### CHAPTER 18 HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE AND HEART DISEASE
- As we studied this model, it became apparent that there were two phases. In the first phase the elevated uric acid was responsible for the high blood pressure. However, over time the rats started to develop vascular lesions in their kidney that resembled arteriolosclerosis along with kidney inflammation. Once this happened, the blood pressure became dependent on salt intake and was driven by the kidney.23 What was exciting is that high blood pressure in humans follows the same pattern, in which early hypertension is often not responsive to changes in salt intake, but in which the blood pressure becomes increasingly responsive to salt intake over time.16 ([Location 2822](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=2822))
- Consistent with this finding, the administration of fructose, sucrose, or high fructose corn syrup to people also raises blood pressure in the first few minutes, and this is associated with a rise in serum uric acid levels.34, 39 We also found that if we gave high doses of fructose to healthy men for two weeks that blood pressure was increased throughout the 24-hour day in association with a rise in fasting serum uric acid levels, and the rise in blood pressure could be prevented if the increase in uric acid was prevented by giving allopurinol.40 Furthermore, some studies suggest that lowering the intake of added sugars can result in a lowering of blood pressure. ([Location 2875](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=2875))
- Sugar intake is therefore likely the grand initiator of high blood pressure, leading first to rises in blood pressure that are primarily observed during ingestion. Over time, serum uric acid levels stay elevated, and the vascular lesions of arteriolosclerosis develop. People who like sugar also tend to eat high amounts of salt.43 There is also some evidence that fructose itself may stimulate the absorption of salt in the intestines.44 Suddenly we have the “perfect storm” for the development of persistent hypertension, as the sugarinduced lesions in the kidney result in the kidney holding onto salt. ([Location 2881](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=2881))
- One way uric acid may increase the risk for strokes is not simply by raising blood pressure, but rather by its ability to cause arteriolosclerosis. The cerebral arterioles have an important role in controlling blood flow to the brain, and will dilate or constrict as needed to help maintain normal pressures and flows. When the arterioles become diseased the ability to regulate blood flow is impaired. In the kidney, for example, our group showed that uric acid caused the arterioles to become diseased and this impaired the ability of the kidney to regulate its blood flow. In turn, if the cerebral arterioles cannot regulate blood flow very well, then sudden changes in blood pressure could lead to dangerous alterations in blood flow to the brain, thereby predisposing to strokes. ([Location 2889](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=2889))
- While people with a high uric acid are at increased risk for stroke, the role of uric acid during a stroke is more controversial. Some studies suggest that those who have a stroke may do better if their uric acid levels are elevated.48 This may fall back to the survival properties of uric acid, such as the ability to block oxidative stress outside the cell. Nevertheless, lowering of uric acid in the post-stroke period is associated with improvement in systemic inflammation and vascular function. ([Location 2895](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=2895))
- Unfortunately, once people develop heart failure, it has been hard to show clinical benefit with drugs that lower uric acid, with possible exception for those with very high (>9.5 mg/dl) uric acid levels. ([Location 2902](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=2902))
- During the periods when an individual does not breathe, the lack of oxygen causes a loss of energy (ATP) in the cells that, in turn, stimulates production of uric acid. As a consequence, some patients with sleep apnea may present with gout as their earliest symptom before they realize there is a sleep disturbance present. ([Location 2933](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=2933))
- Intake of fructose from added sugars is likely important in causing high blood pressure, probably due to the ability of fructose to raise uric acid levels. In turn, increasing evidence suggests uric acid has an important role in stroke, heart failure, and heart and vascular disease. Obesity driven by sugar and uric acid may also have a role in sleep disturbances. ([Location 2962](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=2962))
#### CHAPTER 19 SUGAR ADDICTION AND OBESITY
- The sensation of sweetness is conveyed to the brain by “sweet” receptors in the taste buds that become activated along with receptors in the gut. The sweetness is converted to a pleasure response triggered by the release of dopamine in the center of the brain called the striatum (part of a system known as the basal ganglia). These “pleasure centers” are also activated by sexual arousal or narcotics. Not surprisingly, sugar elicits the same responses, noted by specialized imaging of the brain, as can be induced by narcotics.74 ([Location 2980](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=2980))
- The love for sweets and its addictive potential, which is sometimes referred to as the hedonic drive, may be as important as metabolic mechanisms such as leptin resistance in driving obesity. ([Location 2987](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=2987))
- Unfortunately, repeated bingeing on sugar takes a toll, and the receptors for dopamine in the brain become effectively exhausted and over time start to decrease in number.79-80 Dopamine responses may also decrease with time. The animals now must ingest more sugar to get the same response, and this is a classic feature of addiction.80 At this point the withdrawal of sugar is associated with shaking, teeth chattering, forepaw tremors, agitation, and increased activity, and has similarities to narcotic withdrawal in humans. This withdrawal syndrome to sugar can also be induced by administering drugs that block the dopamine or opiate (opioid) receptors, similar to that which occurs in cocaine-addicted rats. ([Location 2995](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=2995))
- Volkow and colleagues showed in obese humans that the reduction in dopamine receptors in the striatum was associated with less activity in the frontal lobe (as measured by PET scanning) and less emotional control. This leads to impulsiveness, reduces the ability to control behavior, and is likely responsible for the development of food addiction. Since sugar causes a reduction of dopamine receptors in the striatum, sugar not only causes sugar addiction but may also have a role in food addiction. Genetic factors also likely contribute. ([Location 3014](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=3014))
- Sugar therefore increases the risk for obesity not simply by causing leptin resistance, but also by effects on the pleasure response. The reduction in dopamine receptors that occurs with chronic intake of sugar results in the need to eat more sugar for the same response, and to lose the ability to say no in response to the sight of appetizing foods. By blocking the ability to say “no” when appetizing foods are present, chronic ingestion of sugar may increase food intake and cause obesity. ([Location 3021](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=3021))
- These studies suggest that if a drug is developed that can block fructokinase, that it would not block the liking of sugar (sucrose) even though it would largely block the development of obesity. This is good news for the sugar industry. ([Location 3044](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=3044))
- the way sugar causes addiction-like symptoms is not immediate but requires chronic intake so that the dopamine receptors become reduced in the pleasure centers of the brain. Once dopamine receptors are decreased, the frontal lobe region of the brain that controls behavior gets turned off, and this results in the inability to concentrate or control behavior. ([Location 3059](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=3059))
- We believe some cases of ADHD result from the chronic effects of sugar. Children with ADHD have higher serum uric acid levels and the uric acid correlates with the degree of hyperactivity, short attention span, impulsivity, and anger control.105 Low level lead intoxication also increases serum uric acid and is associated with ADHD.106 ADHD is also more common in boys than girls, and boys have higher uric acid levels than girls. ([Location 3072](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=3072))
- high sugar diets might predispose to the development of Alzheimers by stimulating the production of the amyloid proteins in the brain. While sugar may increase the production of amyloid proteins in Alzheimers, it may also have a role in blocking the removal of amyloid proteins. Amyloid protein can be broken down by an insulin degrading enzyme but the action of this enzyme is impaired in the setting of insulin resistance.

#### CHAPTER 20 A KILLER ENZYME THAT DRIVES MODERN DISEASES
- The degree of cell shock induced by fructokinase will relate to the amount of fructose it sees and the level of fructokinase present in the cell. When you drink a soft drink, the load of fructose is large and rapid, which is why soft drinks are so dangerous. As one eats more sugar, the levels of fructokinase slowly rise, which is why sugar is more dangerous in individuals who are already overweight or obese. ([Location 3152](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=3152))
    - Tags: [[health]] 
- The danger in fructose is not so much in its calories, but in its special ability to transiently reduce energy inside the cell. When the energy, or ATP levels, plummet, there is the production of uric acid and oxidants inside the cell. These changes are used by the organism to help it store fat. This happens because the uric acid acts on the energy factories (mitochondria) to preferentially increase fat instead of energy (ATP). The low ATP produced actually encourages the animal to eat more, thereby generating more ATP and further increasing its fat stores. This process appears to be why sugar increases fat so effectively. ([Location 3155](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=3155))
- These studies showed that fructose is likely increasing intestinal permeability and that it is driven by fructokinase in the intestine. ([Location 3203](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=3203))
- The observation that sugar can increase intestinal permeability is likely important in a wide variety of diseases. One important condition is celiac disease. ([Location 3212](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=3212))
- Unlike serious food allergies, which are driven by IgE antibodies, celiac disease is driven by IgA antibodies. IgA is the principal antibody that fights infections that enter through the gut, but it can be produced both in the intestines as well as in the circulation. Celiac disease is a disease of the small bowel in which the lining becomes mildly inflamed. While some patients have minimal symptoms, others develop bloating, diarrhea, and occasionally severe malabsorption. Treatment requires avoiding foods with glutens. ([Location 3214](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=3214))
- While not proven, we believe it is likely that sugar intake is facilitating the development of celiac disease by increasing the intestinal permeability, thus allowing increased access of glutens into the circulation where the IgA response then develops. ([Location 3223](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=3223))
- Similarly, Crohn’s disease is a type of inflammatory bowel disease that is also increasing at alarming rates. In this disease the cause remains unknown, and unlike celiac disease it often prefers the more distant regions of the small bowel, especially the ileum. ([Location 3225](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=3225))
- Sugars containing fructose increase intestinal permeability and likely have an important role in driving food allergy, celiac disease, and Crohn’s disease. ([Location 3232](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=3232))

- We believe the benefit of duodenal bypass on diabetes is because one is bypassing this fructokinase-rich segment of bowel. Once fructokinase inhibitors are available, one will be able to accomplish the same effect without having to undergo surgery. ([Location 3261](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=3261))
- When one ingests fructose, most of it is taken up in the liver and intestines where it is metabolized. However, some fructose enters into the circulation where it is filtered in the kidney and ends up in the filtrate. Here much of the fructose is taken up by the tubules, ([Location 3270](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=3270))
- In the proximal tubule which expresses fructokinase, the absorption of fructose can cause injury with the release of oxidants and inflammation. ([Location 3274](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=3274))
- Recent studies by our group show that diabetic kidney disease is likely driven in part by the conversion of glucose to fructose in the tubules, ([Location 3286](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=3286))
### SECTION 6 PREVENTION, TREATMENT, AND CURE OF OBESITY
#### CHAPTER 21 HEALTHY LIVING: PERSONAL AND PUBLIC HEALTH
- Preventing obesity involves avoiding excessive intake of sugar and umami foods coupled with exercise. ([Location 3307](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=3307))
- As many as two-thirds of young healthy individuals do not absorb fructose very well. Excellent endothelial function and low uric acid levels, which are so common in young people, also help combat the effects of sugar. Over time, however, the continued intake of sugar leads to more and more sugar being absorbed for the same dose, due to the increased expression of the proteins in the gut that aid in the absorption of fructose. A gradual but continued increase in the levels of fructokinase occurs in the liver, and elsewhere, in response to the continued assault of sugar. Slowly the body’s defense systems break down. Leptin resistance develops, and the mitochondrial switch gets turned on that helps convert the energy we eat into fat. The sleeping giant has awakened, stimulating hunger, increasing our body fat, and knocking down our energy. ([Location 3309](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=3309))
- Exercise may be of benefit by helping keep the fat switch from being turned on, as chronic exercise has been shown to lower uric acid levels and to improve mitochondrial function, and even to stimulate the regeneration of mitochondria, which is called mitochondria biogenesis. However, extreme exercise that ([Location 3334](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=3334))
    - Tags: [[health]] 
- During sleep the biological systems associated with stress are turned off, including a decrease in the sympathetic nervous system and a fall in uric acid levels. ([Location 3339](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=3339))
- Preliminary data from our laboratory also suggests that fructose and uric acid may also alter melatonin secretion in laboratory animals. As such, I do not recommend eating sweets immediately prior to going to bed. ([Location 3344](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=3344))
    - Tags: [[health]] 
- I recommend reducing overall intake of added sugars to an average of 4 to 5 teaspoons per day. The first step is to eliminate soft drinks and fruit punches with added sugars, as the effects of fructose relate to the concentration that the liver is exposed to, and this relates not only to the amount ingested but also the rate. Desserts should be eaten on special occasions, such as birthdays, holidays, and weddings, and not be a routine. Candy should be significantly restricted. ([Location 3355](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=3355))
    - Tags: [[health]] 
- Cherries may be particularly healthy as they contain substances that lower uric acid. ([Location 3364](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=3364))
- most natural fruits are safe despite their fructose content. ([Location 3365](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=3365))
- dried fruits are less safe, as the drying process tends to concentrate the fructose while at the same time remove many of the antioxidants. Eating bowls of fruit can also provide a high fructose load despite the benefits of the antioxidants, and fruit juices remain dangerous due to the rapid ingestion with its effect to rapidly raise fructose concentrations in the liver. ([Location 3368](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=3368))
- despite the widespread belief that honey is healthy, I recommend treating honey like sucrose, and to use it sparingly in foods or to limit it to special occasions. ([Location 3373](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=3373))
- At this time we do not know how much starch is being converted to fructose in humans, and it likely varies among individuals. We do have indirect evidence that the conversion of glucose to fructose may be increased in those who are overweight, those with some insulin resistance, and those with high serum uric acid levels. ([Location 3378](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=3378))
- Finally, some artificial sugars can be converted to fructose, or can act as a substitute for fructose in reaction with the killer enzyme, fructokinase. For example, tagatose is a relatively uncommon sugar substitute, but it is even worse than fructose as it reacts vigorously with fructokinase. Another sugar substitute is sorbitol, which is commonly used in syrups. Unfortunately, sorbitol is rapidly absorbed in humans13 where it is metabolized to fructose by the polyol pathway, so it is no safer than sugar. Xylitol is another sugar alcohol that is safer than sorbitol as only a small fraction of xylitol is metabolized by fructokinase.14 This likely accounts for why xylitol is better at preventing caries than sorbitol.15 Nevertheless, xylitol reduces vitamin C levels in the liver16 and can raise serum triglycerides and uric acid in humans when given intravenously.17 Hence, xylitol is also not an ideal sugar substitute. ([Location 3398](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=3398))
- Avoiding sugar substitutes is wise. If you desire something sweet, have a natural fruit. ([Location 3406](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=3406))
- While coffee drinking can be associated with some undesirable side effects, such as diarrhea, reflux, and benign cysts in the breast, coffee also has some health benefits. The greatest benefit appears to be to decrease the risk for diabetes. ([Location 3428](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=3428))
- a likely explanation is that heavy coffee drinking reduces uric acid levels. Heavy coffee drinking is associated with lower serum uric acid levels, likely because one of the metabolites of coffee is 1-methyl xanthine that competitively inhibits the enzyme (xanthine oxidase) that produces uric acid. ([Location 3432](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=3432))
    - Tags: [[health]] 
- The first recommendation is to __take vitamin C, 250 milligrams twice per day__. Vitamin C is an antioxidant that combats many effects of fructose, and it also lowers uric acid. As such, it helps turn off the fat switch. The only problem with vitamin C is that there is some data that at high doses (1 gram daily) interferes with the recovery of mitochondria that occurs with exercise. This is why I would limit the dose to 500 mg daily ([Location 3436](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=3436))
    - Tags: [[health]] 
- I also recommend taking 1000 IU (or 25 micrograms) of vitamin D daily. A lack of vitamin D may not only affect the health of our bones, but also increase our risk for high blood pressure and heart disease. ([Location 3442](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=3442))
    - Tags: [[health]] 
- Since it is the concentration of fructose that is important in activating the fat switch, soft drinks are more likely to cause obesity than solid foods with similar sugar content. ([Location 3489](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=3489))
    - Tags: [[health]] 
- While data is sparse on whether this is beneficial, the fact that fructose can induce low grade inflammation might theoretically provide a basis for why honey might be helpful in the setting of infection. ([Location 3512](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=3512))
#### CHAPTER 22 LOSING WEIGHT: REVISITING THE LOW CARBOHYDRATE DIET
- Losing weight requires both blocking the fat switch and reducing glycogen stores so one can burn fat. ([Location 3529](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=3529))
    - Tags: [[health]] 
- As such, the general rules for reducing fructose-laden sweets and beer are critical for successful weight loss. Diets rich in dairy and cheese, drinking water and reducing salty foods, and supplements of vitamin C and vitamin D are all encouraged. However, while these measures will help prevent further weight gain, a more aggressive approach needs to be done to induce weight loss. Specifically, you need to do measures to burn the excess fat. ([Location 3546](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=3546))
- Recall that with fasting, one initially burns the excess carbohydrates in the body, which is stored as glycogen in the liver. Once the glycogen stores are low, the body switches to burning fat. As such, the key to successful weight loss is to learn how to maximize the burning of fat, and the first step is to reduce the glycogen stores in the liver. This is especially important if you are overweight as obesity is associated with high levels of glycogen in the liver. ([Location 3549](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=3549))
- One of the simplest ways to reduce glycogen in the liver is by fasting. ([Location 3553](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=3553))
    - Tags: [[health]] 
- glycogen is rapidly depleted in the liver while we sleep, and after an eight-hour sleep the stores of glycogen are low. Thus, in the morning we are in a fat-burning mode, and this explains why exercising in the morning on a fasting stomach is more effective at burning fat than later in the day.50-51 Glycogen stores are replenished from carbohydrates in your diet.52-54 Therefore, an effective way to lose weight is to allow the burning of fat to continue during the day by avoiding breakfast or limiting it to only protein and fat (such as an egg or meat). ([Location 3555](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=3555))
- I prefer to have dinner early in the evening. This way I can start to burn the glycogen stores even before I go to sleep. ([Location 3563](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=3563))
- Increasing protein intake is also beneficial and may help quench appetite. However, one does not want to eat large amounts of protein-rich food high in umami, such as organ meats or shellfish. ([Location 3574](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=3574))
- Another approach, which was suggested to me by Dr. Mercola, is to try butter from grass-fed cows. The butter can help suppress the desire for sweets and also help stimulate a sense of fullness (satiety). It is also contains a lot of vitamins (such as vitamin A) and healthy fatty acids (such as omega-3 fatty acids and conjugated linoleic acid). ([Location 3594](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=3594))
    - Tags: [[health]] 
- The reason exercise is so effective likely relates to its ability to stimulate the production of new mitochondria and the generation of ATP.64 Recall that the fat switch acts to preferentially convert energy from food to fat rather than to ATP. ([Location 3604](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=3604))
    - Tags: [[health]] 
- The historical recommendation has been to perform aerobic exercise for 30 minutes each day, but more recent studies suggest that short episodes (3-4 minutes) of high-intensity exercise may be the most beneficial way to reverse insulin resistance and improve overall health. High intensity exercise involves exercise that increases your heart rate to 90-100% of maximum for 30 seconds, followed by 90 seconds of rest for eight cycles. This can be done two to three times per week and may be the most beneficial way to reverse insulin resistance and improve overall health. ([Location 3614](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=3614))
    - Tags: [[health]] 
- It is also possible for exercise fanatics to reduce their fat content to dangerously low levels, which is also not encouraged. Having some fat stores is a good thing, particularly if one gets sick. ([Location 3619](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=3619))
- To lose weight, one has to reduce foods that activate the fat switch and at the same time deplete liver glycogen stores so one can burn fat. The most effective approach is to combine exercise with a low carbohydrate diet, coupled with counseling. ([Location 3645](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=3645))
#### CHAPTER 23 THE NEXT FRONTIER: CURING OBESITY
- To cure obesity, we will need to turn off the fat switch AND stimulate the repair and growth of mitochondria. ([Location 3658](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=3658))
- As we have shown, to become obese one needs to activate a “program” in which certain foods such as fructose and purines cause changes in the mitochondria that result in the shunting of energy to fat. When this happens, the individual loses control of their appetite (due to leptin resistance), develops the metabolic syndrome characterized by insulin resistance and increased fat stores, and reduces their overall energy from reduced ATP production. It is as if we are preparing for hibernation, but we do not stop and keep getting bigger and fatter. This all occurs at the expense of continued oxidative stress to our mitochondria. Eventually, the mitochondria decrease in number and we become “locked in” to our new weight, and in some people our islets give out and we become diabetic. ([Location 3660](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=3660))
##### Blocking the Metabolism of Fructose (Approach 1).
- Fructokinase Inhibitors are likely to be one of the best treatments for obesity. ([Location 3692](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=3692))
##### Turning the Fat Switch Off (Approach 2).
- Blocking AMPD or stimulating AMPK would therefore be another effective way for reversing the switch and curing obesity. ([Location 3696](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=3696))
- Currently the major AMPD inhibitor that is clinically available is metformin. ([Location 3697](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=3697))
- Since metformin is a relatively weak AMPD inhibitor and AMPK stimulant, it provides promise for the future development of similar but more potent drugs. ([Location 3712](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=3712))
- Another promising drug is resveratrol, which is a natural compound present in mulberries, peanuts, grapes and red wine. Resveratrol is also an AMPK stimulant and experimentally has been shown to reduce weight and improve insulin resistance in animal models of metabolic syndrome.

    - Tags: [[health]] 
##### Lowering uric acid (Approach 3).
##### Blocking Injury to the Mitochondria (Approach 4).
- Two general antioxidants with significant promise are vitamin C and N-acetyl cysteine (NAC).97-98 We have already discussed the benefits of vitamin C and I do recommend taking 500 mg daily—higher doses could theoretically be better, but may increase the risk for kidney stones, especially at doses of 2 grams or more.99 Clinical experience with NAC in the treatment of obesity is lacking, although it appears to block obesity in sucrose-fed animals. ([Location 3751](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=3751))
- Ubiquinol is a form of coenzyme Q-10, which is a component in mitochondria that is involved in ATP production. Ubiquinol is the reduced form of this enzyme, which means that it carries antioxidant properties. Since it is fat soluble, it can enter cells and mitochondria, where it may help protect against oxidative stress. ([Location 3756](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=3756))
- I believe that the key to curing obesity is not simply blocking the switch, but also stimulating the repair and regrowth of mitochondria in our tissues. ([Location 3770](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=3770))
- One of the best ways to stimulate mitochondria growth is by exercise, but resveratrol and AICAR also have promise. ([Location 3773](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=3773))

- The benefits of chocolate are due to the presence of flavanols and antioxidants present in the cocoa. Some of these compounds are destroyed during the processing of chocolate, but some is retained in dark chocolate. ([Location 3818](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=3818))
- More recently, several compounds have been isolated from chocolate, of which the flavanol, epicatechin, may be the most important. We have collaborated with Francisco Villarreal from the University of California, San Diego, and have evidence that epicatechin can block many of the effects of fructose in rats. More importantly, epicatechin appears to be one of the most potent stimuli for mitochondrial biogenesis ever discovered.

- It is my belief that the prescription to cure obesity will still include restriction of carbohydrates, a daily exercise program, and counseling. However, there will be a day in which we also administer drugs that block the injury to the mitochondria (such as by blocking AMPD or fructokinase, or lowering serum uric acid) as well as drugs to stimulate mitochondrial growth and repair. ([Location 3831](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=3831))
### SECTION 7 FUTURE CONSIDERATIONS
#### CHAPTER 24 SCIENTIFIC TRUTH, A MOVING FIELD
- A more targeted criticism of studies in laboratory animals is that the fructose is typically administered in large amounts to rats (such as 60 percent of their diet) when humans are ingesting only 10 to 15 percent of their diet as fructose.6-7 Recall, however, that humans are much more sensitive to the effects of fructose because they have the uricase mutation. When we inhibited uricase in rats, they developed features of metabolic syndrome with even low doses of fructose.8 Moreover, it is common in laboratory studies to give large doses of a factor in order to speed up the disease process. For example, insulin resistance occurs within two months in rats fed 60 percent fructose, but it takes 15 months if they are given a diet of 15 percent fructose.9 Likewise, we were able to induce metabolic syndrome in 25 percent of adult men in just two weeks when we supplemented their diet with 200 g of fructose daily (equivalent to nine soft drinks a day).10 This is much more than most people drink, but it is also true that metabolic syndrome normally takes years to develop and to see this occur in just two weeks was striking. Thankfully, these changes reversed when the study was over. ([Location 3904](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=3904))
- Several groups looked at what genes might be involved in controlling uric acid levels, and they were able to identify one gene (the Glut 9 gene) that could account for 3 to 6 percent of the overall serum uric acid level.11-12 The majority of the serum uric acid could not be predicted by genetics, and is consistent with the level of serum uric acid being driven primarily by diet. ([Location 3916](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=3916))
- this genetic variant of Glut 9 works by increasing the movement of uric acid out of cells,13-14 and hence it would be expected to increase the risk for gout but have minimal if any effect on high blood pressure or insulin resistance.

#### CHAPTER 25 DIVINE MUTATIONS, HEROISM AND MIRACLES
- AMP: Adenosine monophosphate. A major breakdown product of DNA, RNA and ATP. AMPD: AMP deaminase. An enzyme that utilizes AMP, generating downstream products such as uric acid. AMPD activation is associated with fat accumulation and an inhibition of AMPK. AMPK: AMP-activated kinase. An enzyme that is activated by AMP and has a major role in burning fat and protecting against diabetes. ATP: Adenosine triphosphate. The primary source of energy for the cell.

- fructokinase: The first enzyme in fructose metabolism, also known as ketohexokinase or KHK. Fructokinase metabolizes fructose to fructose-1-phosphate, and in the process causes transient depletion of ATP and activation of AMPD.

- uric acid: A major breakdown product of DNA, RNA and ATP that circulates in the blood. High levels of uric acid can precipitate as crystals in joints causing the arthritic condition, gout. Uric acid levels are also commonly elevated in people with obesity, metabolic syndrome and heart disease.
  uricase: An enzyme present in most mammals but which was lost in humans and great apes due to a mutation that occurred 15 million years ago. The enzyme acts to degrade uric acid. Animals that lack uricase have higher uric acid levels than other mammals.
  xanthine oxidase: The enzyme that generates uric acid in the cell. It also produces oxidants in this process. ([Location 4141](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XVKUDE&location=4141))
