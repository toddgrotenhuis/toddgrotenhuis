### INTRODUCTION
### CHAPTER THE TIME IS RIGHT FOR REMOTE WORK
- offices have become interruption factories. ([Location 144](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00C0ALZ0W&location=144))
- The ability to be alone with your thoughts is, in fact, one of the key advantages of working remotely. ([Location 150](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00C0ALZ0W&location=150))
- According to the research,* commuting is associated with an increased risk of obesity, insomnia, stress, neck and back pain, high blood pressure, and other stress-related ills such as heart attacks and depression, and even divorce. ([Location 168](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00C0ALZ0W&location=168))
- The big transition with a distributed workforce is going from synchronous to asynchronous collaboration. Not only do we not have to be in the same spot to work together, we also don’t have to work at the same time to work together. ([Location 190](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00C0ALZ0W&location=190))
- we now have unlimited access to culture and entertainment from any location, ([Location 219](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00C0ALZ0W&location=219))
- The new luxury is to shed the shackles of deferred living—to pursue your passions now, while you’re still working. ([Location 231](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00C0ALZ0W&location=231))
- The new luxury is the luxury of freedom and time. ([Location 241](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00C0ALZ0W&location=241))
- Money, in fact, is the perfect Trojan horse for getting the bean counters on your side. Make them see dollar signs where you see greater freedom, more time with the family, ([Location 273](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00C0ALZ0W&location=273))
- Cutting back on commuting also means huge savings for the environment. ([Location 284](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00C0ALZ0W&location=284))
- For other companies where the trappings of success are an important part of the image—for example, advertising agencies or law firms or C-level recruiting outfits—having a showy office may make sense. Acknowledging that the office is there to impress clients sets an owner or manager free to make it the best theater experience it can be—and employees can remain free to work from home when they’re not needed as extras for the scene. ([Location 302](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00C0ALZ0W&location=302))
### CHAPTER DEALING WITH EXCUSES
- Most work is not coming up with The Next Big Thing. Rather, it’s making better the thing you already thought of six months—or six years—ago. ([Location 345](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00C0ALZ0W&location=345))
- Our attitude is, we need a clean plate before going up for seconds. ([Location 350](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00C0ALZ0W&location=350))
- People have an amazing ability to live down to low expectations. ([Location 366](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00C0ALZ0W&location=366))
- If you view those who work under you as capable adults who will push themselves to excel even when you’re not breathing down their necks, they’ll delight you in return. ([Location 368](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00C0ALZ0W&location=368))
- The bottom line is that you shouldn’t hire people you don’t trust, or work for bosses who don’t trust you. ([Location 378](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00C0ALZ0W&location=378))
- the number one counter to distractions is interesting, fulfilling work. ([Location 389](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00C0ALZ0W&location=389))
- Sometimes, distractions can actually serve a purpose. Like the proverbial canary in the coal mine, they warn us—when we feel ourselves regularly succumbing to them—that our work is not well defined, or our tasks are menial, or the whole project we’re engaged in is fundamentally pointless. Instead of reaching for the video game controller or turning on soap operas, is it perhaps time to raise your voice and state the obvious? If you’re feeling like this, chances are others are too. ([Location 391](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00C0ALZ0W&location=391))
- Most people want to work, as long as it’s stimulating and fulfilling. ([Location 402](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00C0ALZ0W&location=402))
- All computers must use hard drive encryption, ([Location 410](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00C0ALZ0W&location=410))
- Disable automatic login, require a password when waking from sleep, and set the computer to automatically lock after ten inactive minutes. ([Location 412](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00C0ALZ0W&location=412))
- Make sure all smartphones and tablets use lock codes and can be wiped remotely. ([Location 416](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00C0ALZ0W&location=416))
- Use a unique, generated, long-form password for each site you visit, kept by password-managing software, ([Location 419](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00C0ALZ0W&location=419))
- False equality benefits nobody. ([Location 440](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00C0ALZ0W&location=440))
- of course it’s true that some jobs simply aren’t a good fit for remote execution. ([Location 462](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00C0ALZ0W&location=462))
- The best way to defuse the “everyone must be bound by the same policy” line of argument is to remind your boss, yourself, and any other concerned party that you’re all on the same team. You’re all in the game to find the best way to work: the most productive and happiness-inducing setup wins. ([Location 466](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00C0ALZ0W&location=466))
- The stronger the culture, the less explicit training and supervision is needed. ([Location 479](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00C0ALZ0W&location=479))
- The best cultures derive from actions people actually take, not the ones they write about in a mission statement. ([Location 482](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00C0ALZ0W&location=482))
- Newcomers to an organization arrive with their eyes open. They see how decisions are made, the care that’s taken, the way problems are fixed, and so forth. ([Location 482](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00C0ALZ0W&location=482))
- not every question needs an answer immediately—there’s nothing more arrogant than taking up someone else’s time with a question you don’t need an answer to right now. ([Location 491](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00C0ALZ0W&location=491))
- Questions you can wait hours to learn the answers to are fine to put in an email. Questions that require answers in the next few minutes can go into an instant message. For crises that truly merit a sky-is-falling designation, you can use that old-fashioned invention called the telephone. ([Location 493](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00C0ALZ0W&location=493))
### CHAPTER HOW TO COLLABORATE REMOTELY
- we’ve found that we need a good four hours of overlap to avoid collaboration delays and feel like a team. ([Location 586](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00C0ALZ0W&location=586))
- Much of the magic that people ascribe to sitting together in a room is really just this: being able to see and interact with the same stuff. ([Location 605](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00C0ALZ0W&location=605))
- It’s also a lot harder to bullshit your peers than your boss. In talking to a project manager without tech chops, programmers can make a thirty-minute job sound like a week-long polar expedition, but if their tall tale is out in the open for other programmers to see, it won’t pass the smell test. ([Location 663](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00C0ALZ0W&location=663))
- If you’re an owner or manager, letting local people work remotely is a great first step toward seeing if remote will work for you. It’s low risk, it’s no big deal, and worse comes to worst, people can start working at the office again. ([Location 683](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00C0ALZ0W&location=683))
- But here’s the thing: if you’re going to give it a shot, give it a real shot. Try it for at least three months. ([Location 685](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00C0ALZ0W&location=685))
- Forcing everyone into the office every day is an organizational SPoF. ([Location 693](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00C0ALZ0W&location=693))
- We believe that these staples of work life—meetings and managers—are actually the greatest causes of work not getting done at the office. That, in fact, the further away you are from meetings and managers, the more work gets done. ([Location 712](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00C0ALZ0W&location=712))
- If you’re calling a meeting, you better be sure pulling seven people away from their work for an hour is worth seven hours of lost productivity. ([Location 722](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00C0ALZ0W&location=722))
- when management is forced to manage remotely using email, Basecamp, IM, and chat, its intervention is much more purposeful and compressed, and we can just get on with the actual work. ([Location 732](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00C0ALZ0W&location=732))
- human interaction does not have to come from either coworkers or others in your industry. Sometimes, even more satisfying interaction comes from spending time with your spouse, your children, your family, your friends, your neighbors: ([Location 743](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00C0ALZ0W&location=743))
- That’s the great irony of letting passionate people work from home. A manager’s natural instinct is to worry about his workers not getting enough work done, but the real threat is that too much will likely get done. And because the manager isn’t sitting across from his worker anymore, he can’t look in the person’s eyes and see burnout. ([Location 758](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00C0ALZ0W&location=758))
- Look at your progress toward the end of the day and ask yourself: “Have I done a good day’s work?” ([Location 765](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00C0ALZ0W&location=765))
- To give it a proper try, you need to set free at least an entire team—including project management and key stakeholders! ([Location 808](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00C0ALZ0W&location=808))
- When you’re used to interrupting anyone any time you want, there’ll be severe withdrawal symptoms when you can’t. ([Location 811](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00C0ALZ0W&location=811))
- First, when pitching businesses, let the prospective client know up front that you don’t live where they live. ([Location 830](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00C0ALZ0W&location=830))
- Second, provide references before the client even asks. Show right up front that you have nothing to hide. Trust is going to be the toughest thing to build early on, so make it as easy as possible for the client to get to know your character by letting them speak with other clients—especially other clients who may be remote. ([Location 833](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00C0ALZ0W&location=833))
- Third, show them work often. This is the best way to chip away at a client’s natural situational anxiety. ([Location 835](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00C0ALZ0W&location=835))
- Fourth, be very available. Since you can’t meet face-to-face, you better return phone calls, emails, instant messages, etc. ([Location 838](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00C0ALZ0W&location=838))
- Lastly, get the client involved and let them follow along. Make sure they feel that this is their project too. ([Location 842](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00C0ALZ0W&location=842))
- This is also exactly how it works if you’re a remote worker wanting to work for a company in a foreign country. Set up that personal company and bill your “salary” as invoices every month. ([Location 866](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00C0ALZ0W&location=866))
### CHAPTER HIRING AND KEEPING THE BEST
- people who’ve been with a company for a long time make ideal remote workers. ([Location 914](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00C0ALZ0W&location=914))
- doing great work with great people is one of the most durable sources of happiness we humans can tap into. ([Location 927](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00C0ALZ0W&location=927))
- If anything, the human connection is even more important when hiring remote workers because it has to be stronger to survive the distance. When the bulk of your communication happens via email and the like, it doesn’t take much for bad blood to develop unless everyone is making their best effort to the contrary. Small misunderstandings that could have been nipped in the bud with a wink of an eye or a certain tone of voice can quickly snowball into drama. That’s one of the key challenges of remote work: keeping everyone’s outlook healthy and happy. ([Location 931](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00C0ALZ0W&location=931))
- The best ballast you can have is as many folks in your boat as possible with a thoroughly optimistic outlook. ([Location 937](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00C0ALZ0W&location=937))
- sentiments are infectious, whether good or bad. ([Location 939](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00C0ALZ0W&location=939))
- It’s never a good idea to let poisonous people stick around to spoil it for everyone else, but in a remote-work setup it’s deadly. ([Location 940](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00C0ALZ0W&location=940))
- No assholes allowed. But for remote work, you need to extend it to no asshole-y behavior allowed, no drama allowed, no bad vibes allowed. ([Location 949](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00C0ALZ0W&location=949))
- Smart solutions, friendly service, and edgy design all happen at the intersection of professional skill and life experience. ([Location 953](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00C0ALZ0W&location=953))
- Magic and creativity thrive in diverse cultures. When you’re seeking remote workers, you have to do even more to encourage and nurture diversity and personal development. ([Location 965](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00C0ALZ0W&location=965))
- Asking to see work product is pretty easy for positions with natural portfolios, such as designer, programmer, or writer. For positions that don’t lend themselves to portfolio accumulation, you can simply pose real-world problems and have the person answer them as part of the application. ([Location 985](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00C0ALZ0W&location=985))
- Instead of thinking I can pay people from Kansas less than people from New York, you should think I can get amazing people from Kansas and make them feel valued and well-compensated if I pay them New York salaries. ([Location 1001](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00C0ALZ0W&location=1001))
- equal pay for equal work across geographies. ([Location 1010](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00C0ALZ0W&location=1010))
- By the same token, as a remote worker, you shouldn’t let employers get away with paying you less just because you live in a cheaper city. “Equal pay for equal work” might be a dusty slogan, but it works for a reason. If with regard to compensation you accept being treated as a second-class worker based on location, you’re opening the door to being treated poorly on other matters as well. ([Location 1013](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00C0ALZ0W&location=1013))
- When the work product is out in the open, it’s much easier to see who’s actually smart (as opposed to who simply sounds smart). ([Location 1026](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00C0ALZ0W&location=1026))
- Being a good writer is an essential part of being a good remote worker. ([Location 1037](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00C0ALZ0W&location=1037))
    - Tags: [[favorite]] 
- There’s simply no getting around it: in hiring for remote-working positions, managers should be ruthless in filtering out poor writers. ([Location 1042](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00C0ALZ0W&location=1042))
- Here are a few books to start with if you’re serious about becoming a better writer: On Writing Well by William Zinsser The Elements of Style by William Strunk and E. B. White Revising Prose by Richard Lanham ([Location 1050](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00C0ALZ0W&location=1050))
    - Tags: [[inbox]] 
- Pre-hiring takes the form of a one- or two-week mini-project. We usually pay around $1,500 for the mini-project. We never ask people to work for free. ([Location 1063](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00C0ALZ0W&location=1063))
- If the candidate is unemployed, they get a week. If they currently have a job, they get two weeks, since they usually have to carve out time at night or on the weekends to do the project. ([Location 1065](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00C0ALZ0W&location=1065))
- We don’t believe in asking people to solve puzzles. Solving real problems is a lot more interesting—and enlightening. ([Location 1069](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00C0ALZ0W&location=1069))
- How did they treat the wait staff? ([Location 1084](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00C0ALZ0W&location=1084))
- If you treat remote work as a low-risk experiment, you’ll be able to iterate, adjust, and try a variety of things to see what works best. ([Location 1118](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00C0ALZ0W&location=1118))
- Going to an industry conference is another good opportunity for team bonding. You’ll learn something new together, and you usually have the evenings free to socialize. ([Location 1155](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00C0ALZ0W&location=1155))
- As a company owner or manager, you need to create and maintain a level playing field—one on which those in and out of the office stand as equals. ([Location 1191](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00C0ALZ0W&location=1191))
- As a manager, you have to accept the fact that people will make mistakes, but not intentionally, and that mistakes are the price of learning and self-sufficiency. ([Location 1227](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00C0ALZ0W&location=1227))
- If you let them, humans have an amazing power to live up to your high expectations of reasonableness and responsibility. ([Location 1240](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00C0ALZ0W&location=1240))
- In reality, it’s overwork, not underwork, that’s the real enemy in a successful remote-working environment. ([Location 1244](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00C0ALZ0W&location=1244))
- It’s everyone’s job to be on the lookout for coworkers who are overworking themselves, but ultimately the responsibility lies with the managers and business owners to set the tone. ([Location 1256](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00C0ALZ0W&location=1256))
### CHAPTER LIFE AS A REMOTE WORKER
- If you still want people in the office every day, change that requirement to every afternoon instead. ([Location 1318](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00C0ALZ0W&location=1318))
- separate the two completely by using different devices: simply reserve one computer for work and another for fun. ([Location 1324](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00C0ALZ0W&location=1324))
- Should you threaten them with the stick or dangle the carrot? As detailed by Alfie Kohn in his wonderful book Punished by Rewards:* neither. Trying to conjure motivation by means of rewards or threats is terribly ineffective. In fact, it’s downright counterproductive. Rather, the only reliable way to muster motivation is by encouraging people to work on the stuff they like and care about, with people they like and care about. ([Location 1353](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00C0ALZ0W&location=1353))
- If you’re a manager and notice that one of your employees is slacking, schedule a one-on-one and find out what’s up. Is the person bored with a project that’s not challenging enough, or are they feeling stuck and, in reaction, procrastinating to avoid a situation that feels impossible? See what you can do to get your employee back on track. The roadblock may be structural, or it may be more personal. ([Location 1367](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00C0ALZ0W&location=1367))
- If seeing the world is your passion, you shouldn’t wait until old age to pursue it. And if you’re working remotely, you can’t use the “but I have a job” excuse to defer living. ([Location 1378](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00C0ALZ0W&location=1378))
- The nomadic lifestyle can be cheaper than you think too. If you don’t burden yourself with a mortgage, car payment, cable TV, and other supposed necessities of modern living, there’s usually more than enough left over for travel and accommodation. ([Location 1391](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00C0ALZ0W&location=1391))
- Routine has a tendency to numb your creativity. ([Location 1399](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00C0ALZ0W&location=1399))
- Changes of scenery, however, can lead to all sorts of new ideas. ([Location 1401](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00C0ALZ0W&location=1401))
- look at the remote option as an opportunity to be influenced by more things and to take in more perspectives than you normally might if you had to be in the same place at the same time every day. ([Location 1406](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00C0ALZ0W&location=1406))
- There are two fundamental ways not to be ignored at work. One is to make noise. The other is to make progress, to do exceptional work. ([Location 1441](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00C0ALZ0W&location=1441))
### CHAPTER CONCLUSION
