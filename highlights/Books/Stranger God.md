## Highlights
- The very people Jesus names in Matthew 25—the prisoner, the homeless, the hungry—are named precisely because we don’t see them. ([Location 89](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754H8J6W&location=89))
- Strangers take us out of our relational comfort zone. Consequently, the God who comes to us in strangers makes us feel anxious and awkward. ([Location 101](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754H8J6W&location=101))
- far too often, Christians have been the worst offenders, the very first to greet strangers with Keep Out signs. ([Location 108](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754H8J6W&location=108))
- the central argument of this book is that hospitality—welcoming God in strangers and seeing Jesus in disguise—begins by widening the circle of our affections, the circumference of our care, the arena of our compassion, and the territory of our kindness. ([Location 124](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754H8J6W&location=124))
- cultivating the will to embrace is hard, emotional work. ([Location 152](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754H8J6W&location=152))
- That brings us to the second missing piece: that hospitality begins as a spiritual discipline, as a habit-forming practice aimed at expanding the bandwidth of our kindness and compassion. Our emotions change when we begin to adopt practices that slowly, over time, reconfigure our feelings and affections. ([Location 152](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754H8J6W&location=152))
- Hospitality to strangers is God’s test of goodness or wickedness. ([Location 219](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754H8J6W&location=219))
- We encounter the risen Lord when we break bread with strangers. ([Location 238](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754H8J6W&location=238))
- When we listen to these stories of hospitality in the Bible, we often get the characters reversed. ([Location 262](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754H8J6W&location=262))
- But as these Bible stories show, we don’t show hospitality to be like Jesus. We show hospitality to welcome Jesus. ([Location 265](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754H8J6W&location=265))
- Our failure to welcome others as Jesus welcomed is rooted in the natural and automatic narrowing of our affections from the many to the few, from the strange to the similar. ([Location 349](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754H8J6W&location=349))
- In the Jewish mystical tradition, tzimtzum is the belief that God constricted and withdrew God’s self to make space for creation. We exist because God makes room for us. Creation is the hospitality of God.[1] ([Location 368](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754H8J6W&location=368))
- Feelings are what exclude people from our friendship and dinner table: ignoring versus noticing, suspicion versus trust, exclusion versus embrace. ([Location 377](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754H8J6W&location=377))
- Hospitality is expanding the moral circle to make room in our hearts for each other. ([Location 414](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754H8J6W&location=414))
- The reason the church so often fails to welcome the lepers of our day and time is that we get the order of embrace all wrong. ([Location 484](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754H8J6W&location=484))
- Instead of touching lepers while they are lepers, as Jesus did, the church tells people to get cleaned up before they can be accepted and welcomed. ([Location 487](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754H8J6W&location=487))
- We welcome people into the circle of our affections when we unconditionally embrace their humanity before we sort, judge, or evaluate them by any other criteria or standards. ([Location 489](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754H8J6W&location=489))
- When a group of Christians really hate a sin, they can’t help growing angry at the people engaging in that sin. The distinction in “love sinners, hate sin” is ultimately impossible to maintain because it excludes the will to embrace. ([Location 502](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754H8J6W&location=502))
- Didn’t Jesus already give his body and blood for torturers when he died on the cross for them? ([Location 583](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754H8J6W&location=583))
- Can we deny to others, even to torturers, what Christ has already freely given away? ([Location 585](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754H8J6W&location=585))
- hospitality may have limits. At the very least, people of good will can disagree about where the limits, if any, might be. ([Location 586](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754H8J6W&location=586))
- We lead with embrace, unconditionally accepting the humanity of all—sinner and saint, oppressor and oppressed. But the yes is followed by an and. Conversations and decisions about holiness, truth telling, justice, and boundaries follow the will to embrace. ([Location 588](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754H8J6W&location=588))
- If the will to embrace is not secured, any conversation about holiness becomes harsh, abusive, and judgmental, the exact opposite of how we see Jesus treat sinners in the Gospels. Similarly, if the will to embrace is not secured in the pursuit of truth and justice, we are tempted to hate oppressors,  failing  to  love  our  enemies  as  Jesus commanded. ([Location 591](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754H8J6W&location=591))
- Psychologically, we treat sin as if it were cooties, a moral contaminant that is passed via physical contact, which becomes another source of interpersonal revulsion. ([Location 633](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754H8J6W&location=633))
- When you experience sinners as a source of moral cooties, Jesus’s hospitality to them is disturbing. What Jesus was doing didn’t feel right. ([Location 637](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754H8J6W&location=637))
- Our churches tend to reflect what we value as Americans: youthfulness, energy, success. We don’t like being reminded of failures of body or mind, or of failed dreams and aspirations. As children of the American dream, we applaud talent, success, youth, and beauty. So our worship stages rarely spotlight the elderly, the disabled, the sick, unemployed, weak, dying, or poor. ([Location 755](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754H8J6W&location=755))
- Second, moral cooties, the discomfort we feel watching Jesus break bread with sinners, is called sociomoral disgust. ([Location 760](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754H8J6W&location=760))
- Core disgust is the heart of disgust, and it’s focused on food... ([Location 760](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754H8J6W&location=760))
- The third type of disgust is called “animal reminder” or “mortality reminder” disgust. I think a better label is “body reminder” disgust, ([Location 765](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754H8J6W&location=765))
- As Americans who pride ourselves on success and self-sufficiency, we’re nauseated by neediness and dependency. Worse, we moralize it. We heap moral cooties upon the needy: not only is it shameful, but you’re a bad person if you are poor. ([Location 769](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754H8J6W&location=769))
- The problem with this fairy-tale world is that it is radically inhospitable to people who remind us of our physical needs and vulnerabilities—the elderly, the intellectually disabled, the physically disabled, the mentally ill, the homeless, the sick, the dying. ([Location 778](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754H8J6W&location=778))
- They suffer so we can keep our dirty little secret. ([Location 782](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754H8J6W&location=782))
- This rehabilitative honoring—giving honor, care, and attention to people who don’t usually get our honor, care, and attention—allows the church to show “equal concern” for everyone: ([Location 807](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754H8J6W&location=807))
    - Tags: [[definition]] 
- The will to embrace flows out of empathy and compassion. And compassion flows out of a recognition of our own weakness,  vulnerability, and neediness. ([Location 836](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754H8J6W&location=836))
- You can be angry at someone while holding onto the will to embrace. ([Location 902](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754H8J6W&location=902))
- The most toxic emotion in a marriage is contempt. Contempt is the emotion most predictive of divorce. ([Location 903](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754H8J6W&location=903))
- The reason for this is that contempt, like disgust, is a dehumanizing emotion. ([Location 904](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754H8J6W&location=904))
- Contempt is a type of disgust, but different in two ways. First, beyond a feeling of revulsion, contempt has an angry edge to it. ([Location 909](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754H8J6W&location=909))
- Second, contempt is hierarchical in nature. The revulsion is directed  downward,  toward  the  people  beneath us. ([Location 910](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754H8J6W&location=910))
- Contempt is a feeling of superiority, often moral superiority. ([Location 912](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754H8J6W&location=912))
- Anger is an egalitarian emotion. ([Location 913](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754H8J6W&location=913))
- Contempt is toxic for any relationship. ([Location 915](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754H8J6W&location=915))
- Hospitality isn’t just about welcoming sinners; it’s also about welcoming people we think are idiots. ([Location 922](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754H8J6W&location=922))

- The contrast between male/female, slave/free, and Jew/Gentile wasn’t political equality. The distinction was honor and shame, superior versus inferior. ([Location 950](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754H8J6W&location=950))
- When our hearts are gripped by fear, the will to embrace evaporates. ([Location 979](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754H8J6W&location=979))
- Hospitality is the exorcism of fear. ([Location 1023](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754H8J6W&location=1023))
- First, fear affects our ability to assess threat and danger accurately. Fear causes us to overestimate risk. Fear makes us paranoid and suspicious. ([Location 1026](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754H8J6W&location=1026))
- The second problem with fear is dehumanization. ([Location 1029](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754H8J6W&location=1029))
- Fear transforms strangers into monsters, into something dangerously less than human. ([Location 1032](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754H8J6W&location=1032))
- Monsters are created when our fear of strangers mixes with disgust. ([Location 1032](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754H8J6W&location=1032))
- Finally, for Christians, the last reason we battle against fear is the most important. We cast out fear because love is risky, especially sacrificial love. ([Location 1039](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754H8J6W&location=1039))
- The real number-one problem for why we don’t extend radical hospitality is mental and physical exhaustion. ([Location 1204](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754H8J6W&location=1204))
- It’s hard to call people to a life of radical hospitality when our lives are governed by a “reverie of lack.” ([Location 1216](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754H8J6W&location=1216))
- The examples that Christians often use to illustrate radical hospitality fill us with both awe and dread. ([Location 1218](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754H8J6W&location=1218))
- These followers of Jesus excite us, but they also scare us or make us feel guilty. ([Location 1219](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754H8J6W&location=1219))
- We exhaust ourselves because we think being like Jesus means performing more and more good deeds. ([Location 1222](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754H8J6W&location=1222))
- Hospitality isn’t sustainable if it is a long list of good deeds we have to perform, year after year after year. ([Location 1228](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754H8J6W&location=1228))
- I don’t want to suggest that there isn’t something spiritually problematic with how busy we are. We really do need to make more room for each other. I think our busyness and our exhaustion are rooted in a spiritual sickness that runs throughout American society. ([Location 1237](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754H8J6W&location=1237))
- Hospitality is, rather, welcoming and being with the people already in our lives: the people at work, the people in your neighborhood, and the people in your kid’s soccer league. ([Location 1242](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754H8J6W&location=1242))
- (Sad to say, but academics like me do this all the time when we talk to non-academic audiences. We talk about ideas and theories, and then, when it’s time to get practical, we say, “Well, I’m a scholar, not a practitioner.” I was embarrassed that I was playing this card.) ([Location 1278](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754H8J6W&location=1278))
- Whatever I was looking for had to be an intentional practice, a habit-forming spiritual discipline. ([Location 1282](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754H8J6W&location=1282))
- the main reason social and economic policy proposals are rejected is that we lack friendships with the people being adversely affected by the status quo. ([Location 1288](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754H8J6W&location=1288))
- Pointing to an example isn’t a practice. That’s like pointing at an NBA star and demanding, “Shoot three-pointers like him!” ([Location 1293](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754H8J6W&location=1293))
- I needed to find a spiritual practice that didn’t add to our overscheduled lives but could be practiced within our lives—a practice anyone could do, no matter how busy they were. No excuses. ([Location 1299](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754H8J6W&location=1299))
- Dorothy Day was like a lot of my college students—all fired up and looking for heroic and radical ways of following Jesus in the world. If that’s what you’re looking for, your first encounter with the Little Way of Thérèse might be unsatisfying. ([Location 1350](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754H8J6W&location=1350))
- Dorothy Day was eventually convinced and became a devotee of Thérèse. After being converted to the Little Way, Day wrote, “Is the atom a small thing? And yet what havoc it has wrought. Is her little way a small contribution to the life of the Spirit? It has all the power of the Spirit of Christianity behind it. It has an explosive force that can transform our lives and the life of the world, once put into effect.” ([Location 1353](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754H8J6W&location=1353))
- The apostle Paul warned some of us about all this—how if we got married, started a family, and took out a mortgage, our loyalties would get divided between family and the kingdom of God. Radical discipleship on the one side is pitted against work and home on the other. Being an all-in radical follower of Jesus seems like a young person’s game. ([Location 1397](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754H8J6W&location=1397))
- Thérèse was just like us. She wanted to do big and radical things for Jesus but found herself stuck in a life that was mundane, dreary, bland, and ordinary. ([Location 1404](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754H8J6W&location=1404))
- But what she discovered after joining the convent is what a lot of us discover after we get our first job or take out our first mortgage: Life gets trapped in routine, and we spend most of it struggling through the dramas of living with a small group of people, year after year after year. ([Location 1412](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754H8J6W&location=1412))
- For Thérèse, the restrictions were the walls and rules of the convent. Our restrictions are the walls built by full schedules, work and school deadlines, and domestic responsibilities. ([Location 1416](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754H8J6W&location=1416))
- Thérèse’s resolution of her vocational crisis is most brilliant because it opens up for us the possibility that anyone, no matter how small and hemmed in that person’s life may be, can be a heroic and radical follower of Jesus. ([Location 1433](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754H8J6W&location=1433))
- Little Things with Great Love ([Location 1436](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754H8J6W&location=1436))
- But it’s hard to die a martyr’s death living as a cloistered nun. ([Location 1443](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754H8J6W&location=1443))
- She was not the hands or the feet or the mouth or the eyes, but the heart. In the whole of the body of Christ, Thérèse laid claim to the heart. ([Location 1455](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754H8J6W&location=1455))
- To practice the Little Way is to follow Thérèse’s example, to be the heart, the affections of the body of Christ. ([Location 1466](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754H8J6W&location=1466))
- “I shall be love”—this is the spiritual foundation of the Little Way. ([Location 1466](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754H8J6W&location=1466))
- The Little Way is to incarnate love in your day-to-day existence with others. ([Location 1467](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754H8J6W&location=1467))
- The discipline of the Little Way is to make every act of sacrifice during the day, every look and every word, flow from love. ([Location 1479](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754H8J6W&location=1479))
- Can you start to appreciate the heroic audacity of the spirituality of the Little Way? When put into practice, it turns out it’s not very little at all. It’s pretty damn hard to do, and you’d be heroic for even trying it. ([Location 1481](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754H8J6W&location=1481))
- Try doing every small thing you do this day with great love. Try waiting in line at the supermarket with great love. Try dealing with an irritating office mate with great love. Try sitting in traffic with great love. Try dealing with your screaming toddler with great love. Try reading your social-media feeds with great love. ([Location 1484](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754H8J6W&location=1484))
- Stop trying to be the gifted and talented eye, mouth, hand, or foot of the church, and try for twenty-four hours being the heart of the church. Try incarnating the affections of Jesus. Try it and tell me if the Little Way isn’t the most heroic and radical thing you’ve ever attempted in your life. ([Location 1486](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754H8J6W&location=1486))
- Dorothy Day described the Little Way as the “democratization of holiness.” ([Location 1491](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754H8J6W&location=1491))
- The pursuit of “radical Christianity” is open to everyone. ([Location 1493](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754H8J6W&location=1493))
- We do the little things with great love. ([Location 1493](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754H8J6W&location=1493))
- When we’re “working on our relationship with God,” what we don’t tend to think about is apologizing to people. ([Location 1517](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754H8J6W&location=1517))
- We’d much rather pray than apologize. Yet over and over in the Bible, we’re told that how we treat people is how we treat God. ([Location 1518](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754H8J6W&location=1518))
- But spending hours online reading, listening, and writing about Jesus isn’t the same as welcoming the Jesus who comes to us in strangers. ([Location 1529](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754H8J6W&location=1529))

- Spiritual disciplines are great. But let’s do the dishes first. ([Location 1546](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754H8J6W&location=1546))
- This is the conclusion I draw from this: I must seek out in recreation, on free days, the company of Sisters who are the least agreeable to me in order to carry out with regard to these wounded souls the office of the Good Samaritan. A word, an amiable smile, often suffice to make a sad soul bloom. ([Location 1574](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754H8J6W&location=1574))
- a kind word or smile to make a sad soul bloom—makes the Little Way something that we practice anytime and anywhere. ([Location 1582](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754H8J6W&location=1582))
- Find someone at work, someone you’ve ignored, and say hello. Seek them out and offer a kind word and smile. ([Location 1585](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754H8J6W&location=1585))
- Ponder the very nature of patience; if it’s anything, it’s mastering our emotions in order to behave kindly toward others. While self-control is a part of all this, the goal of the discipline is to be social and affectional. Patience isn’t merely self-denial; it’s a gift of kindness, love, and hospitality. ([Location 1620](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754H8J6W&location=1620))
- The brain saw the homeless people and drug addicts not as people, but as objects. This is what dehumanization looks like at the neuronal level. ([Location 1675](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754H8J6W&location=1675))
- Nothing can be accomplished by way of welcoming until we notice others. ([Location 1686](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754H8J6W&location=1686))
- in the middle of these annoying  and  irritating  situations,  where  the practice of attention—seeing and noticing the human beings standing right in front of you—is so critical: ([Location 1697](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754H8J6W&location=1697))
- The practice of seeing a ticketing agent in the midst of your fatigue and anger is letting your kindness carve out a space where that agent is protected from the meanness of the world, especially our own meanness. ([Location 1731](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754H8J6W&location=1731))
- The results of the experiment were clear. Only one variable predicted who would stop: time. The seminarians most likely to stop were those who had the time. ([Location 1769](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754H8J6W&location=1769))
- Seeing each other requires that we become interruptible. ([Location 1773](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754H8J6W&location=1773))
- We describe hospitality as “making room,” and we tend to think of this as making room in physical space—making room at our table or making a bed available in our home. The practice of stopping is a different sort of making room. Interruptibility is a practice of making room in time, finding space for others in the midst of our busy day. That’s the inhospitality of hurry; there’s no room for you in my schedule. ([Location 1775](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754H8J6W&location=1775))

- We can make ourselves more interruptible and available to each other by addressing the inhospitable pace of our lives. ([Location 1778](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754H8J6W&location=1778))
- Slowing down is a practice of hospitality because it makes us available to each other. ([Location 1782](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754H8J6W&location=1782))
- When we stop, we must practice being present and available. For me, this often means turning and squarely facing the person. ([Location 1784](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754H8J6W&location=1784))
- these are little practices and disciplines: facing people, staying relaxed, being present, working hard to listen. These are practices of hospitality that widen the circle of our affections—practices that we can work on anytime and anywhere.

    - Note: Context, I believe, is about being interruptible, being hospitable, taking time for people.
- What Darley and Batson’s study with hurried seminarians tells us is that most of us are Jesus hobbyists. We pursue our hobbies when we have free and spare time. And that’s how we treat Jesus. We’ll welcome people like the Good Samaritan when we have the time. We get around to Jesus after all the other important stuff on our To Do list has been checked off. We follow Jesus if we’re available, which means following Jesus has become a hobby. ([Location 1799](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754H8J6W&location=1799))

- The practice of stopping, the discipline of being interruptible, is what turns a hobbyist into a follower of Jesus. ([Location 1802](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754H8J6W&location=1802))

- Because it’s often inconvenient, stopping re-quires discipline. But it’s a discipline that allows Jesus to come to us in disguise. ([Location 1803](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754H8J6W&location=1803))
- practice of seeking out and intentionally approaching people on the social margins, ([Location 1840](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754H8J6W&location=1840))
- A critical aspect of the practice of approaching is intentionally going against the grain of your emotional and social triggers. ([Location 1854](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754H8J6W&location=1854))
- The practice of approaching is habitually leaning in where your default is to lean away, ([Location 1855](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754H8J6W&location=1855))
- The practice of approaching is intentionally reversing this trend, going against the tide of our emotions to widen the circle of our affections. ([Location 1858](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754H8J6W&location=1858))
- The practice of approaching, as Thérèse de-scribes it, is going against our desire to detour. ([Location 1871](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754H8J6W&location=1871))
- The practice of approaching is to move into that awkwardness, into the strangeness. When you are disciplined about this, what you find is that the awkwardness slowly disappears and is replaced by affection and love.

- the Little Way—breaking it down in the practices of seeing, stopping, and approaching ([Location 1905](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754H8J6W&location=1905))
- There is a littleness to the Little Way that can be offensive, especially given all the problems the world is facing. That was the reaction Dorothy Day had upon first encountering the Little Way. ([Location 1908](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754H8J6W&location=1908))
- Live into the practices of seeing, stopping, and approaching, ([Location 1911](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754H8J6W&location=1911))
- You’ll discover that the Little Way is pretty damn heroic. It is one of the most difficult and challenging spiritual-formation practices you’ll ever encounter. ([Location 1912](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754H8J6W&location=1912))
- When we speak about “widening the circle of our affections,” we are talking about the intentional and disciplined practice of seeing, stopping for, and approaching people whom we otherwise would avoid or ignore. ([Location 1926](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754H8J6W&location=1926))
- compassion and empathy have a dark side, and the Little Way protects us from these temptations. ([Location 1928](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754H8J6W&location=1928))
- “While we are alone, we could believe we loved everyone.” That’s my favorite quote from Jean Vanier, ([Location 1929](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754H8J6W&location=1929))
- when we love people generically and abstractly, we can trick ourselves into believing that we love everyone in the entire world. ([Location 1935](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754H8J6W&location=1935))
- But there are some problems with social-media compassion. First of all, compassion is a stress reaction, which can lead to what psychologists call empathy or compassion fatigue. ([Location 1939](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754H8J6W&location=1939))
- In short, our empathy for everyone in the world makes us anxious and upset, leading to depression, despair and cynicism. Eventually, we burn out. ([Location 1945](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754H8J6W&location=1945))

- Compassion, for it to find a healthy and sustainable outlet, needs to find a more personal, more intimate scale of action. ([Location 1946](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754H8J6W&location=1946))

- There’s a famous saying for environmental activism, “Think globally, act locally.” The Little Way is the social version of this. A motto for the Little Way would be “Care globally, love locally.” ([Location 1955](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754H8J6W&location=1955))
- It’s just the simple truth that we love the whole world best by loving the piece of it right in front of us. ([Location 1955](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754H8J6W&location=1955))
- Compassion is a vital first step, but compassion isn’t care, and perhaps most importantly, compassion isn’t a relationship or a friendship. ([Location 1958](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754H8J6W&location=1958))
- Far too many of us love issues more than human beings. ([Location 1959](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754H8J6W&location=1959))

- When we’re alone on social media, we trick ourselves into thinking that we love everyone. This happens because we love and care about all the right issues. ([Location 1959](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754H8J6W&location=1959))
- The trouble with thinking that we love everyone is that it blinds us to how narrow our love actually is. ([Location 1965](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754H8J6W&location=1965))
- The potency of the Little Way is that it forces you to admit and face the ways in which you push people away. ([Location 1969](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754H8J6W&location=1969))
- The Little Way doesn’t let you off the hook with generic, feel-good calls for more love and compassion. ([Location 1970](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754H8J6W&location=1970))
- Heroic, change-the-world activists have to face the fact that you can’t change prejudices through better policy or law. ([Location 1976](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754H8J6W&location=1976))
- the research about how you change prejudice is clear. It happens through interpersonal contact, specifically face-to-face contact, where we interact with each other as equals. ([Location 1984](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754H8J6W&location=1984))
- If interpersonal contact is the only way to overcome bias and prejudice, then you have to be disciplined and intentional in making that contact. ([Location 1996](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754H8J6W&location=1996))
- Wells points out that we like to do things for people because we want to fix things. ([Location 2028](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754H8J6W&location=2028))
- For also makes us feel good. It’s the hero’s role. ([Location 2029](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754H8J6W&location=2029))
- But as you’ve likely noticed, working for people rarely translates into being with people. ([Location 2031](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754H8J6W&location=2031))
- But what about being with the poor and homeless? What about intimacy and friendship? ([Location 2040](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754H8J6W&location=2040))
- The Little Way seems little, unheroic, and inconsequential to us because the Little Way specializes in with rather than for. The Little Way isn’t aimed at fixing people’s problems, working for them. The discipline of the Little Way is being with, widening the circle of our affections to open our hearts to surprising, unexpected friendships. ([Location 2043](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754H8J6W&location=2043))
- The practices of the Little Way—seeing, stopping, and approaching—don’t try to fix people; they make us available to each other. ([Location 2046](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754H8J6W&location=2046))
- Ponder a curious fact about the witness of the early Christians in light of our tendency to focus on electoral politics as the weapon of choice to “change the world.” Following the example of Jesus, the early Christians ignored the state. Instead, they extended care and aid to those in their community who were destitute and in need. The early Christians sold their land and possessions, sharing them with each other so that “there were no needy persons among them” ([Location 2052](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754H8J6W&location=2052))

- Prejudices and discrimination were handled face-to-face in the intimate community of fellow believers. ([Location 2064](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754H8J6W&location=2064))
- Yes, the world is facing huge problems, from poverty to homelessness to prejudice to discrimination. But the early Christians didn’t turn to the state for answers and solutions. They turned toward each other. They fought the battles being waged in their hearts. The early Christians practiced a radical, local politics of care so that there was no needy person among them. The church cared globally but loved locally. The early followers of Jesus created revolutionary social communities where demographic and economic barriers were torn down. And the tool that ignited and sustained this revolution, where the marginalized, downtrodden, and destitute flocked to the fellowship of the early Christians, was koinonia. The first followers of Jesus changed the world through friendship. ([Location 2068](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754H8J6W&location=2068))
- One of the biggest factors associated with poverty in America is concentrated poverty. ([Location 2075](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754H8J6W&location=2075))
- When you have connections and friendships with many and diverse sorts of people, you have a lot of social capital; you are socially “rich.” ([Location 2079](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754H8J6W&location=2079))
- Material poverty, studies tell us, is associated with low social capital. The poor lack wide and diverse friendships. This explains why concentrated poverty is so toxic and why neighbors matter. ([Location 2084](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754H8J6W&location=2084))
- What he found was that people tended to find new jobs through their weak-tie relationships rather than their strong ties. ([Location 2091](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754H8J6W&location=2091))
- Strong ties provide us with support, but weak ties help us search. ([Location 2102](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754H8J6W&location=2102))
- These appeals to our social support network are so normal and natural that we don’t ever notice how vital they are in solving the problems of life. ([Location 2118](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754H8J6W&location=2118))
- On the surface, approaching people to form acquaintances and even surprising friendships doesn’t seem like an effective way to help the poor. But when you realize the strength of weak ties, the Little Way becomes the exact intervention that can help the poor, creating and giving them a deeper and richer social network. As the research on concentrated poverty and social capital reveals, the poor don’t need a handout; they need better neighbors.

- kindness is the elevator to Jesus. ([Location 2190](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754H8J6W&location=2190))
- Imagine what it would be like if Christians gave up trying to love the world for an entire year and instead committed ourselves to practicing kindness—kinder on social media, kinder with our coworkers, kinder with our family, kinder with our friends, kinder with everyone standing with us in line at the grocery store.
