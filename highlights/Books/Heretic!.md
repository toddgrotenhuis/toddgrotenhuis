## Highlights
### 1 Following Jesus: A Ticket Outta Hell or Something
- Given what could be considered some pretty gloomy prognostications, do we not need “saving” from a very real “something?” And is that something not violence? Has it not always been about violence? ([Location 214](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07BH6TBPH&location=214))
- the Gospel has never so much been about posthumous rewards, or being saved from the Father—may it never be that—but about liberation from our enslavement to the violent powers and principalities that structure our out-of-shape world. ([Location 221](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07BH6TBPH&location=221))
- From Jesus, we learn that in spite of our human kingdoms being structured with retributive violence to the extent of seventy-sevenfold— ... the kingdom of God is established by forgiveness offered to one another seventy-sevenfold (Matt 18:22). ([Location 240](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07BH6TBPH&location=240))
- Death and our fear of death is enough of a hell to be saved from. ([Location 282](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07BH6TBPH&location=282))
- what Jesus Christ reveals about the divine is that divinity possesses no violence. ([Location 331](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07BH6TBPH&location=331))
#### 2 Cherry-Picking the Scriptures, New Testament-Style
- To take the Bible seriously is to not take everything literally. ([Location 636](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07BH6TBPH&location=636))
- Sure, some things we should take literally. Jesus told us to literally love our enemies (Matt 5:44; Luke 6:35); he told us to literally bless those who curse us (Luke 6:28); he told us to literally turn the other cheek (Matt 5:39); and he told us to literally be merciful just like our heavenly Father is (Matt 5:48; Luke 6:36). ([Location 637](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07BH6TBPH&location=637))
### 3 The Bible: Rated R for Graphic Divine Violence, Disturbing Images, and Strong Language
- In myth after myth, we have papered over the truth of our victimizing by claiming our violence is sacred, and that we needed it in order to be spared from something dreadful, while those whom we have victimized remain forever silenced, six feet under, or at minimum, far removed from society. Then, almost ironically, because our victims are attached to the ensuing peace, we sometimes even deify them. ([Location 764](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07BH6TBPH&location=764))
- That is to say human religion and culture are founded on violence. The many founding myths—Cain and Abel (Hebrew), Romulus and Remus (Roman), Cadmus and the Dragon (Greek), and so on—all speak to this. But here is where the Bible parts ways with other ancient writings: it includes the voice of the victim. And more than that! The Bible includes the voice of the forgiving victim.

### 4 Marcionite! An In-vogue Strawman
### 5 God made Adam, Eve, and Steve
- After all, every single one of us, from the conservative premillennial dispensationalist to the liberal Anabaptist, has a hermeneutic. ([Location 953](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07BH6TBPH&location=953))
### 6 Indeed Very Many: Universalism in the Early Church
- apokatastasis,” ([Location 1126](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07BH6TBPH&location=1126))
    - Tags: [[definition]] 
- universal reconciliation was unfairly condemned because it was connected with these other contentious ideas. ([Location 1147](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07BH6TBPH&location=1147))
### 7 The Cross of Christ: Pulling a Sacrificial One-Eighty
- By affirming the Resurrection—and as such, our own future resurrection—we open up new possibilities for our love to flow forth in the present. ([Location 1375](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07BH6TBPH&location=1375))
- What I mean is that when the Father puts forth the Son (and, also, when he raises him up), it is to show how the whole sacrificial system is not something he desires, for he never desires death (Ezek 33:11). Rather, we do. ([Location 1397](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07BH6TBPH&location=1397))
- the desire for sacrifice, while historically something we can’t help but project onto the entire pantheon of gods, is shown to be purely a human desire: ([Location 1406](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07BH6TBPH&location=1406))
- The institution of the Eucharist is an inversion of the temple sacrifices. The usual direction of the sacrificial offering is reversed; ... Normally, the worshiper brings the offering into sacred space; here, the upper room is the nonsacred counterpart of the holy of holies, and so the offering is made outside of sacred space. Thus, the sacrificial system is subverted by the reversal of the direction of its ritual logic. ([Location 1417](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07BH6TBPH&location=1417))
- But, what can be disputed is whether the sacrifice of Jesus is something that changes God’s mind about us, or whether it is to change our minds about God. ([Location 1439](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07BH6TBPH&location=1439))
