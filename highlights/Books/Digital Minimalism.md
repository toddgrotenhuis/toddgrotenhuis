## Highlights
### Introduction
- this irresistible attraction to screens is leading people to feel as though they’re ceding more and more of their autonomy when it comes to deciding how they direct their attention. ([Location 69](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRBP7G&location=69))
- they joined Facebook to stay in touch with friends across the country, and then ended up unable to maintain an uninterrupted conversation with the friend sitting across the table. ([Location 72](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRBP7G&location=72))
- In an open marketplace for attention, darker emotions attract more eyeballs than positive and constructive thoughts. ([Location 80](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRBP7G&location=80))
- our culture’s relationship with these tools is complicated by the fact that they mix harm with benefits. ([Location 91](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRBP7G&location=91))
- The most common response to these complications is to suggest modest hacks and tips. Perhaps if you observe a digital Sabbath, or keep your phone away from your bed at night, or turn off notifications and resolve to be more mindful, you can keep all the good things that attracted you to these new technologies in the first place while still minimizing their worst impacts. ... But as is becoming increasingly clear to those who have attempted these types of minor corrections, willpower, tips, and vague resolutions are not sufficient by themselves to tame the ability of new technologies to invade your cognitive landscape ([Location 95](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRBP7G&location=95))
- I’ve become convinced that what you need instead is a full-fledged philosophy of technology use, rooted in your deep values, that provides clear answers to the questions of what tools you should use and how you should use them and, equally important, enables you to confidently ignore everything else. ([Location 103](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRBP7G&location=103))
- a philosophy that prioritizes long-term meaning over short-term satisfaction. ([Location 155](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRBP7G&location=155))
### 1 A Lopsided Arms Race
- People don’t succumb to screens because they’re lazy, but instead because billions of dollars have been invested to make this outcome inevitable. ([Location 225](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRBP7G&location=225))
    - Tags: [[favorite]] 
- it’s probably more accurate to say that we were pushed into it by the high-end device companies and attention economy conglomerates who discovered there are vast fortunes to be made in a culture dominated by gadgets and apps. ([Location 227](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRBP7G&location=227))
- Addiction is a condition in which a person engages in use of a substance or in a behavior for which the rewarding effects provide a compelling incentive to repeatedly pursue the behavior despite detrimental consequences. ([Location 301](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRBP7G&location=301))
- the behavioral addictions connected to technology tend to be “moderate” as compared to the strong chemical dependencies created by drugs and cigarettes. ([Location 312](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRBP7G&location=312))
- in many cases these addictive properties of new technologies are not accidents, but instead carefully engineered design features. ([Location 317](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRBP7G&location=317))
- intermittent positive reinforcement and the drive for social approval. Our brains are highly susceptible to these forces. This matters because many of the apps and sites that keep people compulsively checking their smartphones and opening browser tabs often leverage these hooks to make themselves nearly impossible to resist. ([Location 322](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRBP7G&location=322))
- rewards delivered unpredictably are far more enticing than those delivered with a known pattern. ([Location 328](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRBP7G&location=328))
- Remember that early social media sites featured very little feedback—their operations focused instead on posting and finding information. It tends to be these early, pre-feedback-era features that people cite when explaining why social media is important to their life. ([Location 355](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRBP7G&location=355))
- these companies didn’t invest the massive resources necessary to perfect this auto-tagging feature because it was somehow crucial to their social network’s usefulness. They instead made this investment so they could significantly increase the amount of addictive nuggets of social approval that their apps could deliver to their users. ([Location 390](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRBP7G&location=390))
- Compulsive use, in this context, is not the result of a character flaw, but instead the realization of a massively profitable business plan. ([Location 401](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRBP7G&location=401))
- we’ve been engaging in a lopsided arms race in which the technologies encroaching on our autonomy were preying with increasing precision on deep-seated vulnerabilities in our brains, while we still naively believed that we were just fiddling with fun gifts handed down from the nerd gods. ([Location 408](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRBP7G&location=408))
### 2 Digital Minimalism
- Digital Minimalism A philosophy of technology use in which you focus your online time on a small number of carefully selected and optimized activities that strongly support things you value, and then happily miss out on everything else. ([Location 435](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRBP7G&location=435))
    - Tags: [[favorite]] 
- They tend to be incredibly wary of low-value activities that can clutter up their time and attention and end up hurting more than they help. ([Location 450](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRBP7G&location=450))
- minimalists don’t mind missing out on small things; what worries them much more is diminishing the large things they already know for sure make a good life good. ([Location 452](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRBP7G&location=452))
- “is this the best way to use technology to support this value?” ([Location 480](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRBP7G&location=480))

- Blair told me that keeping up with local events through this bookmarked page takes about five minutes, once or twice a week. ([Location 496](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRBP7G&location=496))
#### THE PRINCIPLES OF DIGITAL MINIMALISM
- the best way to fight the tyranny of the digital in your life is to embrace a philosophy of technology use based in your deeply held values. ([Location 512](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRBP7G&location=512))
- Principle #1: Clutter is costly. ... Principle #2: Optimization is important. ... Principle #3: Intentionality is satisfying. ([Location 516](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRBP7G&location=516))
- To truly extract its full potential benefit, it’s necessary to think carefully about how they’ll use the technology. ([Location 520](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRBP7G&location=520))
- Thoreau establishes early in Walden: “The cost of a thing is the amount of what I will call life which is required to be exchanged for it, immediately or in the long run.” ([Location 562](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRBP7G&location=562))
- It’s easy to be seduced by the small amounts of profit offered by the latest app or service, but then forget its cost in terms of the most important resource we possess: the minutes of our life. ([Location 598](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRBP7G&location=598))
- the law of diminishing returns can apply to the various ways in which we use new technologies to produce value in our personal lives. ([Location 622](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRBP7G&location=622))
- most people’s personal technology processes currently exist on the early part of the return curve—the location where additional attempts to optimize will yield massive improvements. ([Location 644](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRBP7G&location=644))
- The Amish, it turns out, do something that’s both shockingly radical and simple in our age of impulsive and complicated consumerism: they start with the things they value most, then work backward to ask whether a given new technology performs more harm than good with respect to these values. ([Location 701](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRBP7G&location=701))
- approaching decisions with intention can be more important than the impact of the actual decisions themselves. ([Location 723](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRBP7G&location=723))
- ...intention trumps convenience ([Location 726](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRBP7G&location=726))
- Laura also connects efforts to be a “conscientious consumer” with issues relating to social justice, which also play a big role in the Mennonite Church. ([Location 756](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRBP7G&location=756))
- The sugar high of convenience is fleeting and the sting of missing out dulls rapidly, but the meaningful glow that comes from taking charge of what claims your time and attention is something that persists. ([Location 767](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRBP7G&location=767))

### 3 The Digital Declutter
- The Digital Declutter Process Put aside a thirty-day period during which you will take a break from optional technologies in your life. During this thirty-day break, explore and rediscover activities and behaviors that you find satisfying and meaningful. At the end of the break, reintroduce optional technologies into your life, starting from a blank slate. For each technology you reintroduce, determine what value it serves in your life and how specifically you will use it so as to maximize this value. ([Location 788](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRBP7G&location=788))
- The first step of the declutter process, therefore, is to define which technologies fall into this “optional” category. ([Location 823](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRBP7G&location=823))
- consider the technology optional unless its temporary removal would harm or significantly disrupt the daily operation of your professional or personal life. ([Location 841](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRBP7G&location=841))
- Don’t, however, confuse “convenient” with “critical.” ([Location 849](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRBP7G&location=849))
- Mike needed to keep up with personal emails but wanted to avoid compulsive checking, so he made the rule that he could only sign into his account from his desktop PC and not his phone. ([Location 867](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRBP7G&location=867))
- I would estimate around 30 percent of the rules described by participants were caveated with operating procedures, while the remaining 70 percent were blanket bans on using a particular technology. Generally, too many operating procedures might make the declutter experiment unwieldy, but most people required at least a few of these more nuanced constraints. ([Location 876](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRBP7G&location=876))
- In some cases, you’ll abstain from using the optional technology altogether, while in other cases you might specify a set of operating procedures that dictate exactly when and how you use the technology during the process. ([Location 884](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRBP7G&location=884))
- In the end, you’re left with a list of banned technologies along with relevant operating procedures. Write this down and put it somewhere where you’ll see it every day. Clarity in what you’re allowed and not allowed to do during the declutter will prove key to its success. ([Location 886](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRBP7G&location=886))
- This means to an end approach to technology requires clarity on what these ends actually are. ([Location 919](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRBP7G&location=919))
- you must aggressively explore higher-quality activities to fill in the time left vacant by the optional technologies you’re avoiding. This period should be one of strenuous activity and experimentation. ([Location 952](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRBP7G&location=952))
- for each optional technology that you’re considering reintroducing into your life, you must first ask: Does this technology directly support something that I deeply value? ([Location 962](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRBP7G&location=962))
- How am I going to use this technology going forward to maximize its value and minimize its harms? ([Location 975](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRBP7G&location=975))
- The Minimalist Technology Screen To allow an optional technology back into your life at the end of the digital declutter, it must: Serve something you deeply value (offering some benefit is not enough). Be the best way to use technology to serve this value (if it’s not, replace it with something better). Have a role in your life that is constrained with a standard operating procedure that specifies when and how you use it. ([Location 983](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRBP7G&location=983))
- An interesting experience shared by some participants was that they eagerly returned to their optional technologies only to learn they had lost their taste for them. ([Location 1013](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRBP7G&location=1013))
### 4 Spend Time Alone
- give your brain the regular doses of quiet it requires to support a monumental life. ([Location 1121](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRBP7G&location=1121))
- Solitude requires you to move past reacting to information created by other people and focus instead on your own thoughts and experiences—wherever you happen to be. ([Location 1144](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRBP7G&location=1144))
- To Woolf, in other words, solitude is not a pleasant diversion, but instead a form of liberation from the cognitive oppression that results in its absence. ([Location 1180](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRBP7G&location=1180))
- To put this in context, previous technologies that threatened solitude, from Thoreau’s telegraph to Storr’s car phone, introduced new ways to occasionally interrupt time alone with your thoughts, whereas the iPod provided for the first time the ability to be continuously distracted from your own mind. ([Location 1215](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRBP7G&location=1215))
- The smartphone provided a new technique to banish these remaining slivers of solitude: the quick glance. At the slightest hint of boredom, you can now surreptitiously glance at any number of apps or mobile-adapted websites that have been optimized to provide you an immediate and satisfying dose of input from other minds. ([Location 1224](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRBP7G&location=1224))
- Solitude Deprivation A state in which you spend close to zero time alone with your own thoughts and free from input from other minds. ([Location 1245](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRBP7G&location=1245))
- when you avoid solitude, you miss out on the positive things it brings you: the ability to clarify hard problems, to regulate your emotions, to build moral courage, and to strengthen relationships. ([Location 1256](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRBP7G&location=1256))
- The sudden rise in anxiety-related problems coincided with the first incoming classes of students that were raised on smartphones and social media. She noticed that these new students were constantly and frantically processing and sending messages. It seemed clear that the persistent communication was somehow messing with the students’ brain chemistry. ([Location 1272](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRBP7G&location=1272))
- Denizet-Lewis assumed that the teenagers themselves would dismiss this theory as standard parental grumbling, but this is not what happened. “To my surprise, anxious teenagers tended to agree.” A college student he interviewed at a residential anxiety treatment center put it well: “Social media is a tool, but it’s become this thing that we can’t live without that’s making us crazy.” ([Location 1294](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRBP7G&location=1294))
- These teenagers have lost the ability to process and make sense of their emotions, or to reflect on who they are and what really matters, or to build strong relationships, or even to just allow their brains time to power down their critical social circuits, which are not meant to be used constantly, and to redirect that energy to other important cognitive housekeeping tasks. We shouldn’t be surprised that these absences lead to malfunctions. ([Location 1306](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRBP7G&location=1306))
- many have come to accept a background hum of low-grade anxiety that permeates their daily lives. ([Location 1312](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRBP7G&location=1312))
- we need solitude to thrive as human beings, and in recent years, without even realizing it, we’ve been systematically reducing this crucial ingredient from our lives. Simply put, humans are not wired to be constantly wired. ([Location 1315](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRBP7G&location=1315))
- This cycle of solitude and connection is a solution that comes up often when studying people who successfully sidestep solitude deprivation; ([Location 1337](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRBP7G&location=1337))
- It’s exactly this alternation between regular time alone with your thoughts and regular connection that I propose as the key to avoiding solitude deprivation in a culture that also demands connection. ([Location 1342](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRBP7G&location=1342))
#### PRACTICE: LEAVE YOUR PHONE AT HOME
- This rise of cell phone as vital appendage is supported by many different explanations. Young people, for example, worry that even temporary disconnection might lead them to miss out on something better they could be doing. Parents worry that their kids won’t be able to reach them in an emergency. Travelers need directions and recommendations for places to eat. Workers fear the idea of being both needed and unreachable. And everyone secretly fears being bored. ([Location 1360](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRBP7G&location=1360))
- I recommend that you try to spend some time away from your phone most days. This time could take many forms, from a quick morning errand to a full evening out, depending on your comfort level. ([Location 1391](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRBP7G&location=1391))
#### PRACTICE: TAKE LONG WALKS
- On a regular basis, go for long walks, preferably somewhere scenic. Take these walks alone, which means not just by yourself, but also, if possible, without your phone. ([Location 1455](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRBP7G&location=1455))
- If you cannot abandon your phone for logistical reasons, then put it at the bottom of a backpack so you can use it in an emergency but cannot easily extract it at the first hint of boredom. ([Location 1457](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRBP7G&location=1457))
#### PRACTICE: WRITE LETTERS TO YOURSELF
- These notebooks play a different role: they provide me a way to write a letter to myself when encountering a complicated decision, or a hard emotion, or a surge of inspiration. By the time I’m done composing my thoughts in the structured form demanded by written prose, I’ve often gained clarity. ([Location 1504](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRBP7G&location=1504))
- I do make a habit of regularly reviewing these entries, but this habit is often superfluous. It’s the act of writing itself that already yields the bulk of the benefits. ([Location 1506](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRBP7G&location=1506))
- 5 Don’t Click “Like” ([Location 1523](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRBP7G&location=1523))
- Our brains, in many ways, can be understood as sophisticated social computers. ([Location 1559](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRBP7G&location=1559))
- there’s a particular set of regions in the brain that consistently activate when you’re not attempting to do a cognitive task, and that just as consistently deactivate once you focus your attention on something specific. ([Location 1578](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRBP7G&location=1578))
- When given downtime, in other words, our brain defaults to thinking about our social life. ([Location 1593](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRBP7G&location=1593))
- Put another way, our brains adapted to automatically practice social thinking during any moments of cognitive downtime, and it’s this practice that helps us become really interested in our social world. ([Location 1599](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRBP7G&location=1599))
- They found that when users received “targeted” and “composed” information written by someone they know well (e.g., a comment sent by a family member), they felt better. On the other hand, receiving targeted and composed information from someone they didn’t know well, or receiving a “like,” or reading a status update broadcast to many people didn’t correlate with improved well-being. ([Location 1650](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRBP7G&location=1650))
- They found, for example, that if you increase the amount of likes or links clicked by a standard deviation, mental health decreases by 5 to 8 percent of a standard deviation. ([Location 1674](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRBP7G&location=1674))
- The studies that found positive results focused on specific behaviors of social media users, while the studies that found negative results focused on overall use of these services. ([Location 1678](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRBP7G&location=1678))
- The key issue is that using social media tends to take people away from the real-world socializing that’s massively more valuable. ([Location 1691](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRBP7G&location=1691))
    - Tags: [[favorite]] 
- Our brains evolved during a period when the only communication was offline and face-to-face. ([Location 1699](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRBP7G&location=1699))
- Humans are naturally biased toward activities that require less energy in the short term, even if it’s more harmful in the long term—so ([Location 1707](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRBP7G&location=1707))
- In her 2015 book, Reclaiming Conversation, Turkle draws a distinction between connection, her word for the low-bandwidth interactions that define our online social lives, and conversation, the much richer, high-bandwidth communication that defines real-world encounters between humans. ([Location 1725](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRBP7G&location=1725))
- digital communication tools, if used without intention, have a way of forcing a trade-off between conversation and connection. ([Location 1749](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRBP7G&location=1749))
- I refer to this philosophy by the superfluously alliterative name conversation-centric communication. ([Location 1755](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRBP7G&location=1755))
- The philosophy of conversation-centric communication takes a harder stance. It argues that conversation is the only form of interaction that in some sense counts toward maintaining a relationship. This conversation can take the form of a face-to-face meeting, or it can be a video chat or a phone call—so long as it matches Sherry Turkle’s criteria of involving nuanced analog cues, such as the tone of your voice or facial expressions. Anything textual or non-interactive—basically, all social media, email, text, and instant messaging—doesn’t count as conversation and should instead be categorized as mere connection. In this philosophy, connection is downgraded to a logistical role. This form of interaction now has two goals: to help set up and arrange conversation, or to efficiently transfer practical information (e.g., a meeting location or time for an upcoming event). Connection is no longer an alternative to conversation; it’s instead its supporter. If you subscribe to conversation-centric communication, you might still maintain some social media accounts for the purposes of logistical expediency, but gone will be the habit of regularly browsing these services throughout your day, sprinkling “likes” and short comments, or posting your own updates and desperately checking for the feedback they accrue. With this in mind, there would no longer be much purpose in keeping these apps on your phone, where they will mainly serve to undermine your attempts at richer interaction. They would instead more productively reside on your computer, where they’re occasionally put to specific use. Similarly, if you adopt conversation-centric communication, you’ll still likely rely on text-messaging services to simplify information gathering, or to coordinate social events, or to ask quick questions, but you’ll no longer participate in open-ended, ongoing text-based conversations throughout your day. The socializing that counts is real conversation, and text is no longer a sufficient alternative. ([Location 1761](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRBP7G&location=1761))
#### PRACTICE: DON’T CLICK “LIKE”
- And while you’re at it, stop leaving comments on social media posts as well. No “so cute!” or “so cool!” Remain silent. ([Location 1836](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRBP7G&location=1836))
- If you eliminate these trivial interactions cold turkey, you send your mind a clear message: conversation is what counts—don’t be distracted from this reality by the shiny stuff on your screen. ([Location 1841](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRBP7G&location=1841))
- I urge you, for the sake of your social well-being, to adopt the baseline rule that you’ll no longer use social media as a tool for low-quality relationship nudges. ([Location 1859](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRBP7G&location=1859))
#### PRACTICE: CONSOLIDATE TEXTING
- Once you no longer treat text interactions as an ongoing conversation that you must continually tend, it’s much easier to concentrate fully on the activity before you. ([Location 1886](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRBP7G&location=1886))
- By simply keeping your phone in Do Not Disturb mode by default, and making texts something you check on a regular schedule—not a persistent background source of ongoing chatter—you can maintain the major advantages of the technology while sidestepping its more pernicious effects. ([Location 1908](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRBP7G&location=1908))
#### PRACTICE: HOLD CONVERSATION OFFICE HOURS
- Put aside set times on set days during which you’re always available for conversation. ([Location 1935](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRBP7G&location=1935))
- Coffee shop hours are also popular. ([Location 1942](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRBP7G&location=1942))
- I’ve also seen people deploy daily walks for this purpose. ([Location 1948](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRBP7G&location=1948))
### 6 Reclaim Leisure
- Those of us who study the intersection of technology and culture are well read in the small but popular journalistic subgenre in which the author describes the experience of taking a temporary break from modern technologies.

- In recent years, as the boundary between work and life blends, jobs become more demanding, and community traditions degrade, more and more people are failing to cultivate the high-quality leisure lives that Aristotle identifies as crucial for human happiness. This leaves a void that would be near unbearable if confronted, but that can be ignored with the help of digital noise. ([Location 1998](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRBP7G&location=1998))
- Erecting barriers against the existential is not new—before YouTube we had (and still have) mindless television and heavy drinking to help avoid deeper questions—but the advanced technologies of the twenty-first-century attention economy are particularly effective at this task. ([Location 2001](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRBP7G&location=2001))
- If you want to succeed with digital minimalism, you cannot ignore this reality. If you begin decluttering the low-value digital distractions from your life before you’ve convincingly filled in the void they were helping you ignore, the experience will be unnecessarily unpleasant at best and a massive failure at worse. ([Location 2005](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRBP7G&location=2005))
- the value you receive from a pursuit is often proportional to the energy invested. ([Location 2096](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRBP7G&location=2096))

#### Leisure Lesson #1: Prioritize demanding activity over passive consumption.
- In the absence of a well-built wood bench or applause at a musical performance to point toward, you can instead post a photo of your latest visit to a hip restaurant, hoping for likes, or desperately check for retweets of a clever quip. ([Location 2138](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRBP7G&location=2138))
- If you want to fully extract the benefits of this craft in your free time, in other words, seek it in its analog forms, ([Location 2155](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRBP7G&location=2155))
#### Leisure Lesson #2: Use skills to produce valuable things in the physical world.
- Playing games also provides permission for what we can call supercharged socializing—interactions with higher intensity levels than are common in polite society. ([Location 2182](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRBP7G&location=2182))
- The most successful social leisure activities share two traits. First, they require you to spend time with other people in person. ... The second trait is that the activity provides some sort of structure for the social interaction, including rules you have to follow, insider terminology or rituals, and often a shared goal. ([Location 2243](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRBP7G&location=2243))
#### Leisure Lesson #3: Seek activities that require real-world, structured social interactions.
- In this new state, digital technology is still present, but now subordinated to a support role: helping you to set up or maintain your leisure activities, but not acting as the primary source of leisure itself. ([Location 2286](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRBP7G&location=2286))
- new technology, when used with care and intention, creates a better life than either Luddism or mindless adoption. ([Location 2290](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRBP7G&location=2290))
#### PRACTICE: FIX OR BUILD SOMETHING EVERY WEEK
- My suggestion is that you try to learn and apply one new skill every week, over a period of six weeks. ([Location 2345](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRBP7G&location=2345))
#### PRACTICE: SCHEDULE YOUR LOW-QUALITY LEISURE
- You can’t, in other words, build a billion-dollar empire like Facebook if you’re wasting hours every day using a service like Facebook. ([Location 2364](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRBP7G&location=2364))
- schedule in advance the time you spend on low-quality leisure. ([Location 2376](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRBP7G&location=2376))
- There are two reasons why this strategy works well. First, by confining your use of attention-capturing services to well-defined periods, your remaining leisure time is left protected for more substantial activities. ... The second reason this strategy works well is that it doesn’t ask you to completely abandon low-quality diversions. ([Location 2379](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRBP7G&location=2379))
- the vast majority of regular social media users can receive the vast majority of the value these services provide their life in as little as twenty to forty minutes of use per week. ([Location 2393](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRBP7G&location=2393))
- This is why, when defending their products, they prefer to focus on the question of why you use them, not how you use them. Once people start thinking seriously about the latter question, they tend to recognize that they’re spending way too much time online. ([Location 2396](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRBP7G&location=2396))
#### PRACTICE: JOIN SOMETHING
#### PRACTICE: FOLLOW LEISURE PLANS
- I suggest you strategize this part of your life with a two-level approach consisting of both a seasonal and weekly leisure plan. ([Location 2445](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRBP7G&location=2445))
- A good seasonal plan contains two different types of items: objectives and habits that you intend to honor in the upcoming season. The objectives describe specific goals you hope to accomplish, with accompanying strategies for how you will accomplish them. The habits describe behavior rules you hope to stick with throughout the season. In a seasonal leisure plan, these objectives and habits will both be connected to cultivating a high-quality leisure life. ([Location 2451](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRBP7G&location=2451))
- For each of the objectives in the seasonal plan, figure out what actions you can do during the week to make progress on these objectives, and then, crucially, schedule exactly when you’ll do these things. ([Location 2482](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRBP7G&location=2482))
- The weekly planning ritual can lead you to begin fighting for more leisure opportunities. ([Location 2503](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRBP7G&location=2503))
### 7 Join the Attention Resistance
- the “attention economy” describes the business sector that makes money gathering consumers’ attention and then repackaging and selling it to advertisers. ([Location 2535](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRBP7G&location=2535))
- Extracting eyeball minutes, the key resource for companies like Google and Facebook, has become significantly more lucrative than extracting oil. ([Location 2553](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRBP7G&location=2553))
- Now imagine that Facebook started charging you by the minute. How much time would you really need to spend in the typical week to keep up with your list of important Facebook activities? For most people, the answer is surprisingly small; somewhere around twenty to thirty minutes. ([Location 2580](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRBP7G&location=2580))

- Critical use is a critical problem for the digital attention economy. ([Location 2587](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRBP7G&location=2587))
- Put another way, to approach attention economy services with the intentionality proposed by Ginsberg and Burke is not a commonsense adjustment to your digital habits, but is instead better understood as a bold act of resistance. ([Location 2602](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRBP7G&location=2602))
- My research on digital minimalism has revealed the existence of a loosely organized attention resistance movement, made up of individuals who combine high-tech tools with disciplined operating procedures to conduct surgical strikes on popular attention economy services—dropping in to extract value, and then slipping away before the attention traps set by these companies can spring shut.

#### PRACTICE: DELETE SOCIAL MEDIA FROM YOUR PHONE
#### PRACTICE: TURN YOUR DEVICES INTO SINGLE-PURPOSE COMPUTERS
- What makes general-purpose computing powerful is that you don’t need separate devices for separate uses, not that it allows you to do multiple things at the same time. ([Location 2680](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRBP7G&location=2680))
- the power of a general-purpose computer is in the total number of things it enables the user to do, not the total number of things it enables the user to do simultaneously. ([Location 2689](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRBP7G&location=2689))
#### PRACTICE: USE SOCIAL MEDIA LIKE A PROFESSIONAL
- Have a careful plan for how you use the different platforms, with the goal of “maximizing good information and cutting out the waste.” ([Location 2771](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRBP7G&location=2771))
#### PRACTICE: EMBRACE SLOW MEDIA
- You don’t make a conscious decision about each of the sites and feeds you end up visiting; instead, once the sequence is activated, it unfolds on autopilot. The slightest hint of boredom becomes a trip wire to activate this whole hulking Rube Goldberg apparatus. ([Location 2802](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRBP7G&location=2802))
- Checking ten different sites ten times a day makes them money, even if it doesn’t leave you more informed than checking one good site once a day. This behavior, in other words, is not a natural reaction to an increasingly connected age, but instead a lucrative tic bolstered by powerful economic pressures.

- To embrace news media from a mind-set of slowness requires first and foremost that you focus only on the highest-quality sources. Breaking news, for example, is almost always much lower quality than the reporting that’s possible once an event has occurred and journalists have had time to process it. ([Location 2809](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRBP7G&location=2809))
- Similarly, consider limiting your attention to the best of the best when it comes to selecting individual writers you follow. ([Location 2816](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRBP7G&location=2816))
- you should constrain your attention to the small number of people who have proved to be world class on the topics you care about. ([Location 2818](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRBP7G&location=2818))
- It’s a general rule of slow movements that a small amount of high-quality offerings is usually superior to a larger amount of low-quality fare. ([Location 2823](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRBP7G&location=2823))

- Another tenet of slow news consumption: if you’re interested in commentary on political and cultural issues, this experience is almost always enhanced by also seeking out the best arguments against your preferred position. ([Location 2824](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRBP7G&location=2824))
- To foster the state of “full concentration” promoted by the Slow Media Manifesto, I further recommend that you ritualize this consumption by choosing a location that will support you in giving your full attention to the reading. I also recommend that you care about the particular format in which you do this reading. ([Location 2835](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRBP7G&location=2835))
- Serious news consumers also tend to deploy browser plug-ins or aggregation tools that can present them with articles stripped clean of advertisements and clickbait. ([Location 2842](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRBP7G&location=2842))
#### PRACTICE: DUMB DOWN YOUR SMARTPHONE
- According to Clough, the main inconvenience he experiences about life without a smartphone is his inability to google something on the go: “But how great I feel without a smartphone far outweighs that.” ([Location 2863](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRBP7G&location=2863))
- I’m also convinced that we cannot unlock this potential until we put in the effort required to take control of our own digital lives—to confidently decide for ourselves what tools we want to use, for what reasons, and under what conditions. ([Location 2964](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRBP7G&location=2964))
