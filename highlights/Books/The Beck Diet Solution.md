### chapter 2 What Really Makes You Eat
#### The Thought Comes First
- You may not be conscious of it, but you always have a thought before you eat. ([Location 365](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00M70SA0I&location=365))
#### How Thoughts Can Sabotage Your Diet
##### Sabotaging thoughts encourage you to eat.
- you have a number of “permission-giving” thoughts that allow you to rationalize what you eat. ([Location 385](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00M70SA0I&location=385))
##### Sabotaging thoughts undermine your confidence.
##### Sabotaging thoughts allow you to disregard the advice in this book.
##### Sabotaging thoughts increase your general level of stress.
- Every time you resist eating something you shouldn’t, you’re strengthening your tendency to resist in the future. ([Location 411](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00M70SA0I&location=411))
    - Tags: [[favorite]] 
- So whenever you feel the urge to eat something you’re not supposed to, think about which muscle you really want to strengthen. ([Location 412](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00M70SA0I&location=412))
#### Eating Begins with a Trigger
#### From Trigger to Eating
- what usually happens is that you find your tension abating as you reach for the food—before you put it in your mouth. ([Location 457](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00M70SA0I&location=457))
- just as the decision to eat can reduce tension, the decision not to eat can also reduce tension. ([Location 458](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00M70SA0I&location=458))
#### A Great Example of Helpful Thinking
- That’s great that I didn’t eat them. ([Location 481](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00M70SA0I&location=481))
#### the solution at a glance
- When you encounter a trigger, your thoughts determine whether you act in a productive way that strengthens your resistance muscle or in an unproductive way that strengthens your giving-in muscle. ([Location 490](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00M70SA0I&location=490))

##### Make Your Advantages Response Card
##### Use Your Advantages Response Card
##### Remember to Read Your Advantages Response Card
##### Motivate Yourself to Read Your Advantages Response Card Daily
- I need to read my Advantages Response Card at least twice a day if I want to resist temptation. It’ll take only a few seconds. It’s not a big deal. I might not need it psychologically today, but I’ll need it soon. I have to cement these reasons in my mind for when the going gets tough. ([Location 947](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00M70SA0I&location=947))
##### Face Reality!
##### what are you thinking?
- But think about all the times I strayed from a diet in the past. I sure wasn’t thinking of all the advantages of sticking to it then! ([Location 968](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00M70SA0I&location=968))
- I’m going to have to train myself to do what I need to do, not what I feel like doing at the moment. If I put off this task, I might end up never doing it. ([Location 972](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00M70SA0I&location=972))

##### today’s to-do list

- Start now by telling yourself, Good job, or the equivalent every time you sit down to eat, read a Response Card, and complete every other weight-loss task in this program. ([Location 1220](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00M70SA0I&location=1220))
- When you give yourself credit every time you do something right, though, you can more easily see such slips as momentary mistakes, not earthshaking events, and head off a sense of hopelessness. ([Location 1223](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00M70SA0I&location=1223))

##### How and When to Give Yourself Credit

- Giving myself credit is a skill that I’ll build over time. It’s okay if it seems forced in the beginning. The more I practice this skill, the better I’ll get at it and the more automatic and natural it will become. ([Location 1298](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00M70SA0I&location=1298))

- If I needed to take time for a lifesaving medical procedure three times a day, I’d somehow find the time. I’m not giving eating properly a high enough priority. ([Location 1401](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00M70SA0I&location=1401))

##### The Benefits of Writing Down What You Eat
- At some point during your diet, I guarantee that you’ll feel tempted to stop monitoring in writing what you eat. Usually, this happens when you stray from your diet and are trying to avoid facing it and feeling bad. When you notice this temptation, take a step back. It’s 10 times more important to write things down at these times. ([Location 2467](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00M70SA0I&location=2467))
- Checking off what you’ve eaten and writing down what you hadn’t planned to eat forces you to become aware of what you’re doing. You can’t fool yourself when you’re looking at the evidence in black and white. ([Location 2473](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00M70SA0I&location=2473))
##### How to Monitor in Writing What You Eat
- 1. Put a check mark next to the things you ate that were written on your plan. 2. Cross out anything you had planned to eat but didn’t. 3. Circle any food that you ate too much of and write down and circle any food you ate that you hadn’t planned to eat. ([Location 2489](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00M70SA0I&location=2489))

- Sabotaging Thought: This is too much work. Helpful Response: I won’t have to write things down for the rest of my life. Besides, it’ll probably be less burdensome than I’m predicting.

##### today’s to-do list
#### day 18 Change Your Definition of Full
- Here’s a way to determine if you’ve overeaten: Think about how easy it would be to take a walk at a moderate to brisk pace before you eat. You should be able to walk at the same pace just as easily after a meal, too. If you can’t easily take a moderate to brisk walk after a meal, it means that you’ve eaten too much and you might have an unrealistic definition of fullness. ([Location 2788](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00M70SA0I&location=2788))
- Your definition of fullness might be part of the reason you gained weight in the first place or have had difficulty losing weight. ([Location 2792](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00M70SA0I&location=2792))
- You might link the sensation of overfullness with feeling safe or protected from discomfort. ([Location 2797](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00M70SA0I&location=2797))
##### Break the Connection
- You’ll need lots and lots of experiences of eating to normal fullness and saying to yourself,
  "This is great that I’m stopping now." ([Location 2802](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00M70SA0I&location=2802))
- Could I easily go for a moderate to brisk walk? ([Location 2811](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00M70SA0I&location=2811))

### chapter 8 Week 4 Respond to Sabotaging Thoughts
#### day 22 Say, Oh, Well, to Disappointment
- At some point, the disadvantages of dieting will seem to outweigh the advantages. ... It takes time to change a mindset that took years to form. ([Location 3194](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00M70SA0I&location=3194))
- You can either make yourself miserable by railing against the fates that “put you in this situation,” or you can accept the disadvantages of dieting as a necessary means to an end. ([Location 3198](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00M70SA0I&location=3198))

- Many dieters give themselves permission to eat when confronted with issues of fairness. ([Location 3287](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00M70SA0I&location=3287))
- You have a choice when you have thoughts about dieting, eating, food, or weight that start with It’s unfair that.... You can dwell on this negative notion and feel bad, or you can say, That’s true ... It’s not fair ... Oh, well. Then refocus your thoughts on all the advantages in life you have that others don’t. ([Location 3290](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00M70SA0I&location=3290))

For the other 164 hours of the week, they hadn’t struggled. During most of these other hours, they hadn’t even thought about dieting. Yet they all initially reported that the entire week had been intolerable. ([Location 3394](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00M70SA0I&location=3394))
