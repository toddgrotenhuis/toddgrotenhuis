## Highlights
#### Where It All Started: Jacob’s Story
#### Beginnings: The Lowery Perspective
#### The Turning Point
#### About This Book
- there is an alternative fuel source that our bodies can use under various conditions—a fuel source that is more efficient and often underutilized. That source is ketones. Ketone bodies are produced when the body metabolizes, or breaks down, fat. ([Location 281](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0744GMHSQ&location=281))
- There are three kinds of ketone bodies: • acetoacetate (AcAc) • beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) • acetone (Acetone is actually produced by breaking down acetoacetate, making it more of a by-product, but for our purposes, it can be considered a ketone body.) ([Location 284](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0744GMHSQ&location=284))
#### The Other Fuel
#### Diet-Induced Ketosis and the Ketogenic Diet Defined
- Non-starvation, diet-induced ketosis (nutritional ketosis) differs from starvation-induced ketosis in that the production of ketones is typically lower due to the fact that food is being consumed. ([Location 346](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0744GMHSQ&location=346))
- Although it’s different for everyone, a well-formulated ketogenic diet is typically high in fat (more than 65 percent) and extremely low in carbohydrate (5 to 10 percent) ([Location 347](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0744GMHSQ&location=347))
- consuming carbohydrates, too much protein, and too little fat can prevent the production of ketones. ([Location 371](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0744GMHSQ&location=371))
- it is difficult to tell whether someone will get into ketosis from macronutrient ratios alone without knowing other individualized variables, such as physical activity level, total caloric intake, and health conditions. ([Location 376](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0744GMHSQ&location=376))
    - Tags: [[health]] 
- the actual amount of each macronutrient may vary slightly from person to person depending on goals and health parameters such as insulin sensitivity, body composition, gender, and activity level. ([Location 384](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0744GMHSQ&location=384))
- A ketogenic diet is one in which glucogenic (glucose-producing) substrates (non-fiber carbohydrates and glucogenic amino acids) are low enough to force the body to rely primarily on fat as fuel and increase the production of ketone bodies. ([Location 386](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0744GMHSQ&location=386))
#### The Physiology of Diet-Induced Ketosis
- On a ketogenic diet, the glycogen stored in the liver can be depleted in approximately forty-eight hours ([Location 392](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0744GMHSQ&location=392))
- Carbohydrates are the primary trigger for the release of the hormone insulin, which triggers the uptake of glucose from the bloodstream into the cells. Insulin also halts the utilization of fat as fuel and promotes its storage—so when insulin is high, fat isn’t burned. ([Location 400](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0744GMHSQ&location=400))
- Burning fat is, of course, what produces ketone bodies. ([Location 403](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0744GMHSQ&location=403))
- To summarize, the physiology of diet-induced ketosis involves the lowering of blood glucose, stored glycogen, and insulin levels. The result is an enhanced release and reliance on fat as fuel. Finally, these fats are converted to ketone bodies, which can provide an alternative and more effective fuel source for the body. ([Location 404](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0744GMHSQ&location=404))
#### Doesn’t Eating Fat Make You Fat?
- the liver can create glucose from certain amino acids/proteins through the process of gluconeogenesis. Therefore, rather than consume just “low carb” and high protein, individuals on a ketogenic diet eat very low carb and increase their fat intake while maintaining or slightly increasing their protein intake. ([Location 416](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0744GMHSQ&location=416))
- Rather, it is the combination of high amounts of fat and high amounts of carbohydrates. ([Location 437](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0744GMHSQ&location=437))
#### Keto Adaptation
- How much fat do you think this individual is storing? It may astound you to learn that even a thin person may be storing 30,000 to 60,000 calories in the form of fat! In an average-sized individual, this number can go to 100,000, and someone who’s obese may be storing 200,000 calories’ worth of fat. Thus we are in no short supply of energy—all of us have body fat. However, we often lack the ability to tap into and utilize that body fat. ([Location 459](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0744GMHSQ&location=459))
- Research shows that these keto adaptations include, but are not limited to, increasing the number of mitochondria (fat-burning machinery) in a cell, elevating blood ketone levels, and enhancing the body’s ability to take in and use ketones at the cellular level (Volek et al., 2015; Volek et al., 2016). ([Location 480](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0744GMHSQ&location=480))
#### Diabetic Ketoacidosis
- During fasting or on a low-carbohydrate diet, insulin levels drop and insulin sensitivity—insulin’s ability to interact efficiently with the cells—improves. ([Location 511](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0744GMHSQ&location=511))
#### Is the Ketogenic Diet Just Another Low-Carb Diet?
- while a ketogenic diet is low in carbohydrates, a low-carb diet isn’t necessarily ketogenic. ([Location 559](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0744GMHSQ&location=559))
#### CHAPTER SUMMARY
#### Where It All Started
- The ultimate question became: is it possible to receive the benefits of fasting while still consuming calories? ([Location 672](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0744GMHSQ&location=672))
#### The Study Heard ’Round the World
- Many other studies had similar results showing that high dietary cholesterol (cholesterol consumed in the diet) didn’t necessarily lead to high blood cholesterol levels, and the focus on dietary cholesterol began to fade. ([Location 791](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0744GMHSQ&location=791))
- When the researchers looked at deaths from all causes rather than isolating heart disease, they found that mortality had a negative correlation with fat intake: people in countries with higher fat intakes were actually living longer. When all the data were presented, the only positive correlation with deaths from all causes was consumption of carbohydrates ([Location 821](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0744GMHSQ&location=821))
#### Hello from the Other Side
- At the time, researchers did not have to disclose conflicts of interest, so no one knew about Hegsted’s big payday. His pay-for-play agreement with the sugar industry is a classic example of how an ethically irresponsible decision can have an effect for generations to come. ([Location 898](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0744GMHSQ&location=898))
#### The Resurgence of the Ketogenic Diet
#### Exogenous Ketones: An Emerging Area of Research
- Unfortunately, there are two downsides to ketone esters: one, they are currently very expensive, and two, they taste like jet fuel. ([Location 1032](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0744GMHSQ&location=1032))
#### CHAPTER SUMMARY
- There are numerous ways to induce nutritional ketosis. You could refrain from eating entirely (i.e., fast) or, at the opposite end of the spectrum, you could consume 70 to 100 percent of your calories in the form of fat. ([Location 1143](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0744GMHSQ&location=1143))
#### Ketogenicity and the Ketogenic Ratio
- A diet’s ketogenicity is its ability to induce ketogenesis (the production of ketones) in the body and therefore elevate blood ketone levels. ([Location 1153](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0744GMHSQ&location=1153))
    - Tags: [[definition]] 
- Ketogenic Ratio (Cohen et al., 2009): ([Location 1154](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0744GMHSQ&location=1154))
    - Tags: [[definition]] 
- Protein gets a bit tricky since it is both ketogenic and anti-ketogenic. (Some amino acids found in protein, such as leucine and lysine, can be ketogenic, while others, like alanine, are anti-ketogenic.) ([Location 1159](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0744GMHSQ&location=1159))
- Ketogenic Ratio = grams of fat / (grams of protein + grams of carbohydrate). ([Location 1163](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0744GMHSQ&location=1163))
    - Tags: [[definition]] 
- Most people tend to eat a more modified ratio of around 2:1, ([Location 1168](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0744GMHSQ&location=1168))
- When it comes to therapeutic modalities such as epilepsy, a 4:1 ratio is commonly prescribed. ([Location 1169](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0744GMHSQ&location=1169))
- Because fibrous carbohydrates don’t have a glucose or insulin response and are not completely digested, they don’t inhibit ketogenesis like sugar or sugary foods do. ([Location 1181](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0744GMHSQ&location=1181))
- while the Ketogenic Ratio is nice as a basic guideline, you still must account for other factors—such as total calories consumed; sources of fat, carbohydrate, and protein; activity level; and meal frequency—when designing the best approach for you. ([Location 1182](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0744GMHSQ&location=1182))
#### Carbohydrates
##### Glycemic Index and Glycemic Load
- For the average person on a carbohydrate-based diet, blood glucose fluctuates from 80 to 120 mg/dL when fasting. When a person’s blood glucose ranges from 125 mg/dL when fasting to more than 200 mg/dL after eating, that individual is said to be either pre-diabetic or diabetic. ([Location 1210](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0744GMHSQ&location=1210))
- Your blood glucose should be lower on a ketogenic diet than on a carbohydrate-based diet. ([Location 1217](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0744GMHSQ&location=1217))
- The glycemic index is a scale from 1 to 100 that describes how fast a food raises blood glucose after it is consumed. Pure glucose is set at 100, and everything else is compared to that. ([Location 1219](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0744GMHSQ&location=1219))
- To determine glycemic load, you take the amount of carbohydrates per serving of the food, multiply by its glycemic index, and then divide by 100. ([Location 1223](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0744GMHSQ&location=1223))
##### Fiber and Total Carbohydrates versus Net Carbohydrates
- The great thing about fiber is that it has been shown to lower body fat, assist in managing diabetes, improve insulin sensitivity, decrease the risk of heart disease, elevate satiety, and foster beneficial bacteria in our guts ([Location 1239](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0744GMHSQ&location=1239))
    - Tags: [[favorite]] 
- the fermentation of fiber in the gut produces short-chain fatty acids (SCFA), such as acetate, butyrate, and propionate, which are also ketogenic. ([Location 1241](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0744GMHSQ&location=1241))
- We believe it is paramount to maintain fiber intake on a ketogenic diet (by consuming green leafy vegetables and fibrous foods) and focus on reducing net carbohydrates: total carbohydrates minus fiber (see the table, opposite). ([Location 1246](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0744GMHSQ&location=1246))
- Green and cruciferous vegetables are great ways to add fiber and volume. ([Location 1263](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0744GMHSQ&location=1263))
- First, some of the “fibers” that are used in these items actually do increase blood glucose and insulin levels, thus they technically aren’t fibers. The FDA is currently looking deeper into these false fibers to require companies to adjust their product labels accordingly. ([Location 1288](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0744GMHSQ&location=1288))
- some of these sugar alcohols (for example, the maltitol found in sugar-free gummy bears) can have an effect on blood glucose and, worse, tear up your stomach if consumed in high amounts. ([Location 1294](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0744GMHSQ&location=1294))
#### Fats
##### Saturated and Unsaturated Fats
- Increased consumption of monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids has been shown to increase blood ketones (Fuehrlein et al., 2004) and lower blood triglycerides (Volek et al., 2000), which are a risk factor for heart disease. ([Location 1325](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0744GMHSQ&location=1325))
- Saturated fats often are feared due to the correlational research discussed earlier in the book. However, saturated fats convey many health benefits, including elevating HDL cholesterol and increasing LDL cholesterol size (which is a good thing; we want large LDL, not little particles that can get stuck and lead to plaque formation and buildup). In the presence of a low-carbohydrate diet, saturated fats are easily metabolized and broken down ([Location 1326](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0744GMHSQ&location=1326))
- the FDA recently stepped in to state that trans fats are no longer “generally recognized as safe” ([Location 1336](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0744GMHSQ&location=1336))
##### Essential Fatty Acids
- we recommend consuming salmon, mackerel, or even Dr. D’Agostino’s favorite, sardines, frequently since these fish are high in omega-3 fatty acids and ALA. In addition, we suggest adding foods like flax seed to keto-friendly milkshakes or other recipes and selecting a daily fish oil supplement with at least 2 grams of EPA and DHA combined. ([Location 1351](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0744GMHSQ&location=1351))
##### Short- and Medium-Chain Fatty Acids
- short-chain fatty acids are the most ketogenic and that, in general, a shorter carbon chain is more ketogenic. ([Location 1359](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0744GMHSQ&location=1359))
- short-chain fatty acids are abundant in dairy-based fats such as butter and cream, ([Location 1360](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0744GMHSQ&location=1360))
- MCTs are less likely than long-chain triglycerides (LCTs) to be stored as fat because their shorter carbon chain length enables them to be digested rapidly. ([Location 1364](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0744GMHSQ&location=1364))
- Foods high in MCTs are coconut oil (50 percent) and butter and heavy cream (from 4 to 12 percent). ([Location 1378](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0744GMHSQ&location=1378))
- Unfortunately, for many people, MCT supplementation may cause an upset stomach. Therefore, we recommend starting low (2 to 5 grams) and working your way up to 5 to 10 grams per serving to test your tolerance and help reduce upset stomach. ([Location 1379](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0744GMHSQ&location=1379))
#### Protein
- It has been proposed that protein intake should not exceed 20 to 25 percent of a person’s diet, as a higher intake might make it difficult to get into ketosis because protein contains glucogenic amino acids (e.g., alanine) that theoretically could be utilized to make glucose when needed. However, research in epilepsy patients showed that a modified Atkins diet consisting of approximately 64 percent fat and 31 percent protein (a 2:1 ratio) was as effective as a traditional 4:1 ratio ketogenic diet at reducing seizure risk ([Location 1395](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0744GMHSQ&location=1395))
#### Micronutrient and Electrolyte Considerations
- broccoli, cauliflower, spinach, and even avocados and eggs (with the yolks) are packed with essential vitamins and minerals. ([Location 1413](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0744GMHSQ&location=1413))
##### Sodium
- Insulin increases sodium retention by boosting sodium reabsorption; therefore, low insulin levels lead to increased fluid and sodium excretion ([Location 1420](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0744GMHSQ&location=1420))
##### Potassium
##### Magnesium and Calcium
- Magnesium deficiencies are common; however, due to the excretion of key minerals that occurs due to low insulin levels on a ketogenic diet, magnesium also should be supplemented or eaten in the form of foods such as avocados or nuts. ([Location 1437](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0744GMHSQ&location=1437))
##### Electrolyte Supplementation
- sodium, potassium, calcium, and even magnesium may need to be supplemented on a ketogenic diet, especially at the onset. ([Location 1450](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0744GMHSQ&location=1450))
#### Meal Frequency and Intermittent Eating
- individuals experience hunger on fasting days during the first two weeks, but after that they tend to adapt (Varady et al., 2013). Why? It’s possible that because intermittent eating raises ketone levels, after an adjustment period the body is able to switch easily between getting fuel from food and getting fuel from ketones (Johnson et al., 2007). ([Location 1475](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0744GMHSQ&location=1475))
- Have coffee with heavy cream or MCTs for breakfast and lunch and eat a normal dinner (time-restricted feeding). This is a type of “fat fast” that mimics the normal fasting response, yet you consume calories in the form of straight fat. ([Location 1488](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0744GMHSQ&location=1488))
#### CHAPTER SUMMARY
- In general, you should aim to keep net carbohydrates to less than 10 percent of your diet and eat at least 15 grams of fiber each day. ([Location 1498](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0744GMHSQ&location=1498))
#### Ketones: The Fourth Macronutrient
#### Ketone Body Metabolism and Uptake
- our bodies can increase MCT transporters in order to allow more ketones to be taken up into the cells. One way to do so is to increase exercise. Exercise boosts the body’s capacity to utilize ketones and take them up into skeletal muscle due to the fact that lactate, which is produced during exercise, and ketones both use MCT transporters. When exercising, the lactic acid that is built up in your muscles is also cleared by MCT transporters. ([Location 1649](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0744GMHSQ&location=1649))
- the more physically active you are, the more MCT transporters you are likely to have. ([Location 1653](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0744GMHSQ&location=1653))
- Thus it is important to keep in mind that blood ketone levels may not be the most accurate indication of your level of ketosis. ([Location 1655](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0744GMHSQ&location=1655))
#### Medium-Chain Triglycerides (MCTs)
- Look for an MCT powder that is bound to soluble corn fiber rather than maltodextrin to get the best effects and to incorporate a combination of C8, C6, C10, and even C12 into your diet. ([Location 1712](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0744GMHSQ&location=1712))
#### The Effects of Exogenous Ketones: A Unique “Superfuel”
#### Ketone Salts versus Ketone Esters
#### Ketone Isomers: Is There a Difference?
- All that being said, with ketone salts becoming more and more popular in the U.S., it is important to be wary of impurities from ketone salt production, such as crotonic acid and other impurities that can reside in the raw materials. Products from manufacturers trying to take shortcuts often have high elevations of these impurities that, when consumed in large amounts, may have contraindications over time. Therefore, look for products that are third-party-tested and research-backed and that use the highest-quality natural forms of BHB. ([Location 1860](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0744GMHSQ&location=1860))
- The type of ketone isomer may play a unique role in the attenuation of seizures. ([Location 1888](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0744GMHSQ&location=1888))
#### CHAPTER SUMMARY
- MCT transporters act as tunnels to help take up ketones into the cells and can be increased with exercise. ([Location 1906](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0744GMHSQ&location=1906))
#### Section 1: Appetite Control and Weight Loss
#### The Hunger Problem
- Studies have found more than thirty gene variants that may explain differences in body weight between lean and obese individuals. ([Location 2257](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0744GMHSQ&location=2257))
- Three main processes regulate food intake, all of which are controlled in an area of the brain known as the hypothalamus. ([Location 2269](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0744GMHSQ&location=2269))
- First, similar to how a thermostat regulates the temperature in a house, our bodies have an internal “nutrient stat.” When the nutrient stat detects that levels of nutrients like glucose, fatty acids, and ketones are high, the brain sends out signals for hunger to be low (Obici et al., 2002). ([Location 2270](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0744GMHSQ&location=2270))
- Second, our bodies have a mechanical response to food. When the volume of food we eat expands and distends our guts (Martin et al., 2007), our brains receive a mechanical signal that we are full. ([Location 2272](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0744GMHSQ&location=2272))
- Finally, we have hunger and satiety hormones that control the amount of food we eat (Sumithran et al., 2011). Ghrelin is a common hormone that increases hunger, and its opposing hormone, leptin, increases satiety so we eat less. ([Location 2275](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0744GMHSQ&location=2275))
#### Maximizing Weight Loss: Low-Fat or Ketogenic?
- In order to make 1 gram of glucose, 10 grams of fat need to be broken down (Volek et al., 2007), so the simple fact that the ketogenic diet restricts carbs and, to a lesser extent, protein means that more fat needs to be used to create the glucose needed for certain body processes that rely on glucose. ([Location 2333](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0744GMHSQ&location=2333))
- feed efficiency, which refers to how much fat is stored for every calorie of food consumed. ([Location 2336](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0744GMHSQ&location=2336))
    - Tags: [[definition]] 
#### How Much Will You Lose? It Depends on You
- It might take longer for individuals who are insulin resistant to see the same metabolic benefits of a ketogenic diet as those who are insulin sensitive. ([Location 2359](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0744GMHSQ&location=2359))
- Research shows that people who are overweight and insulin resistant tend to have impaired mitochondrial function and fewer mitochondria overall ([Location 2360](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0744GMHSQ&location=2360))
- Keep in mind that the process of adapting to a ketogenic diet takes time. If you are overweight and insulin resistant, the true metabolic advantages of ketogenic dieting likely will not manifest themselves fully until you’ve been on the diet for at least several weeks. ([Location 2368](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0744GMHSQ&location=2368))
- a diet’s metabolic advantage may be indicated not by the total resting calories expended per day but by long-term metabolic changes, such as a lowered ability to efficiently store energy (feed efficiency). ([Location 2393](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0744GMHSQ&location=2393))
- Normal fasting (pre-meal) blood glucose levels in non-diabetic individuals are around 70 to 99 mg/dL, and glucose levels two hours post-meal should be less than 140 mg/dL. If your levels remain higher than 140 mg/dL, you may want to have your doctor check you for insulin resistance. ([Location 2406](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0744GMHSQ&location=2406))
#### Can Weight Loss Be Sustained on a Ketogenic Diet?
#### Cyclic Ketogenic Dieting: Can You Have Your Cake and Eat It, Too?
- Therefore, a cyclic ketogenic diet, which does not allow for fat adaptation, may be disadvantageous for fat loss. ([Location 2446](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0744GMHSQ&location=2446))
- More studies and more data are needed to truly determine whether carbohydrates can be utilized as a strategic tool and whether “cheat days” can be mitigated by exercise. ([Location 2456](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0744GMHSQ&location=2456))
- A protein-sparing modified fast involves consuming a reduced number of calories (typically fewer than 1,000 calories per day) but incorporating enough protein to maintain muscle mass. ([Location 2470](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0744GMHSQ&location=2470))
#### Exogenous Ketones for Weight Loss
- Ketones certainly are not a magic weight-loss supplement, and they are unlikely to directly cause fat loss—they are an energy source. ([Location 2479](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0744GMHSQ&location=2479))
- white adipose tissue (WAT): that’s what tends to be stored around the waist, hips, and butt. ([Location 2492](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0744GMHSQ&location=2492))
    - Tags: [[definition]] 
- brown adipose tissue (BAT). BAT’s function is to generate body heat, ([Location 2492](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0744GMHSQ&location=2492))
    - Tags: [[definition]] 
- Insulin sensitivity can be defined as the amount of insulin the pancreas needs to produce in order to deposit a certain amount of glucose. ([Location 2523](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0744GMHSQ&location=2523))
- “Telling an obese person to eat less and move more is like telling a depressed person to quit being sad.” ([Location 2543](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0744GMHSQ&location=2543))
- Companies literally create food items with the goal of making us become addicted to them. ([Location 2546](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0744GMHSQ&location=2546))
- If you want to experiment with these approaches, make sure that you are completely fat-adapted first (don’t start increasing carbs during your first couple of weeks on the diet), incorporate the extra carbs on an exercise/training day, and minimize the glucose load as much as possible (don’t hit a buffet and wipe out all the desserts!). ([Location 2582](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0744GMHSQ&location=2582))
#### Section 2: Diabetes, Cholesterol, and Heart Health
- Sugar has been demonstrated to have a euphoric effect and produce behaviors and biological responses similar to drug addictions (Avena, 2009; see Figure 5.2.1); ([Location 2764](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0744GMHSQ&location=2764))
- While dysfunctional insulin is the hallmark of all kinds of diabetes, each type has its own pathology. ([Location 2787](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0744GMHSQ&location=2787))
- Someone who is insulin sensitive might need only a small amount of insulin to move a certain amount of glucose into a cell, while someone who is insulin resistant would need a lot of insulin to move the same amount of glucose. That’s why people who are insulin sensitive are more likely to stay lean even if they eat a lot of sweets: the carbs they eat are more likely to be moved into cells to be used for fuel ([Location 2831](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0744GMHSQ&location=2831))
- Because red blood cells live for three months, a person’s HbA1c level gives an average of blood sugar levels over the previous three months. ([Location 2851](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0744GMHSQ&location=2851))
- Even walking can positively affect insulin sensitivity. ([Location 2857](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0744GMHSQ&location=2857))
- Although glucose-lowering agents like metformin and insulin injections may be helpful in the short term, they treat the symptom (high blood sugar) rather than the root cause (insulin resistance). ([Location 2878](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0744GMHSQ&location=2878))
- low-glycemic diets that are still high in carbohydrates aren’t much better than high-glycemic diets (Westman et al., 2016). The most effective form of glycemic control is to couple a low-glycemic diet with carbohydrate restriction. ([Location 2890](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0744GMHSQ&location=2890))
- Measures of HbA1c indicate average blood sugar levels over the previous eight to twelve weeks. HbA1c levels of 6.5 percent and above are indicative of type 2 diabetes, whereas levels lower than 6 percent are considered normal. ([Location 2932](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0744GMHSQ&location=2932))
- Ketones also seem to be beneficial in treating nephropathy, a kidney disease related to damaged capillaries that is common in diabetics. ([Location 2979](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0744GMHSQ&location=2979))
- one of the positive things that Ancel Keys did was to disprove the theory that dietary cholesterol directly contributes to blood cholesterol. ([Location 3034](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0744GMHSQ&location=3034))
- Consumption of foods high in glucose has been associated with the activation of genes that promote the production of fat, while consumption of foods high in fructose has been associated with elevated circulating blood lipids after a meal (Chong et al., 2007). ([Location 3086](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0744GMHSQ&location=3086))
#### Section 3: Neurodegenerative Diseases
- Mitochondria also play a role in autophagy, the process of breaking down and recycling damaged or unnecessary proteins in a cell, which is essential for proper cell function. They are essential for insulin sensitivity; when mitochondria are impaired, the result is an impairment in the ability to use glucose. Finally, mitochondria produce reactive oxygen species (ROS), highly unstable oxygen-containing molecules that can serve several positive signaling effects in the cell. However, an overproduction of ROS can damage tissue and DNA (Balaban et al., 2005). ([Location 3316](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0744GMHSQ&location=3316))
- Research indicates that ketogenic dieting and exogenous ketones may improve mitochondrial energy production when components of the mitochondria that normally produce energy from glucose are damaged. ([Location 3332](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0744GMHSQ&location=3332))
- Additionally, ketones themselves may increase the formation of new mitochondria in various neurological disorders (Kim et al., 2010; Bough et al., 2006). ([Location 3333](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0744GMHSQ&location=3333))
- It is likely that Parkinson’s is an extension of insulin resistance and that those who have it are “starving” for an alternative energy source because they are unable to use glucose effectively. Ketogenic diets may be able to overcome this deficit by improving insulin sensitivity and providing an alternative energy source (Borghammer et al., 2010). ([Location 3362](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0744GMHSQ&location=3362))
- Amyloid plaques are formed from amyloid precursor protein, which is thought to help repair injured neurons in the brain (Panza et al., 2014). When this protein isn’t broken down properly, sticky fragments clump together on the outsides of neurons, forming plaques. The result is impaired neuronal communication, heightened inflammatory responses, blood vessel hemorrhage, and ultimately neuron death (Castello et al., 2014). ([Location 3543](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0744GMHSQ&location=3543))
- The buildup of plaques is thought to initiate the formation of neurofibrillary tangles. These tangles are made of a protein called tau. Tau forms part of the framework of neurons and is essential for nutrient and signal transfer across the cell (Castello et al., 2014). The buildup of plaques changes the shape of the tau protein, causing it to clump up and tangle together. This tangling damages the integrity of the neuron, and cell death ensues. ([Location 3546](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0744GMHSQ&location=3546))
- Alarming epidemiological studies have shown that individuals with diabetes are ten times more likely to develop Alzheimer’s disease (Talbot et al., 2012). ([Location 3558](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0744GMHSQ&location=3558))
- With both type 2 diabetes and Alzheimer’s disease, insulin resistance is present: insulin is unable to move glucose from the bloodstream into the cells. In type 2 diabetes, this occurs primarily in the muscles and liver. In Alzheimer’s patients, it occurs primarily in the brain (Zhao et al., 2009; Kleinridders et al., 2014). ([Location 3560](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0744GMHSQ&location=3560))
- Glucose may be the brain’s primary fuel source in individuals on a carbohydrate-based diet, but research in fasting studies has shown that the brain can get as much as 85 percent of its fuel from ketones (Castellano et al., 2015). ([Location 3575](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0744GMHSQ&location=3575))
- Unlike glucose, the transportation and uptake of ketones in the brain are not decreased in Alzheimer’s patients. ([Location 3587](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0744GMHSQ&location=3587))
- ...it seems that the earlier Alzheimer’s is detected and a ketogenic diet is initiated, the better the chance for improvements. ([Location 3611](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0744GMHSQ&location=3611))
- By the time cognitive impairments due to Alzheimer’s disease are apparent and a patient receives a diagnosis of Alzheimer’s, a great deal of atrophy in the brain has already occurred. ([Location 3624](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0744GMHSQ&location=3624))
- taking too much MCTs can cause gastrointestinal distress, ([Location 3642](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0744GMHSQ&location=3642))
- Following a concussion or blow to the head, a cascade of events occurs that causes a robust increase in energy needs in the brain. At the same time, TBI impairs the brain’s ability to use glucose. Think about that for a moment: the brain needs more energy than it usually does, yet it has an impaired ability to use glucose as an energy source. This results in an energy crisis that causes secondary injury to the brain (Barkhoudarian et al., 2011). ([Location 3729](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0744GMHSQ&location=3729))
- Ketogenic diets lower apoptosis, or cell death, which is the main pathway through which TBI lesions spread. ([Location 3795](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0744GMHSQ&location=3795))
- TBI results in an energy crisis in the brain and impaired glucose metabolism for several days or even months following the trauma. ([Location 3835](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0744GMHSQ&location=3835))
#### Section 4: Cancer
- genes that can impact cancer (oncogenes) and tumor suppressor genes (anti-oncogenes). ([Location 4220](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0744GMHSQ&location=4220))
    - Tags: [[definition]] 
- Cancer can also be classified as carcinoma or sarcoma. A carcinoma is a malignant tumor of the epithelial tissue—the tissue that covers surfaces (like the outsides of organs). Most of the cancers found in humans, including breast and lung cancer, are carcinomas. Sarcomas are malignant tumors arising in connective tissue, such as bone or blood. These kinds of cancer are rarer than carcinomas but are more often fatal. ([Location 4247](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0744GMHSQ&location=4247))
    - Tags: [[definition]] 
- Healthy cells don’t ferment lactate in the presence of oxygen, but cancer cells do, in a process called aerobic glycolysis. Lactate fermentation is one of cancer cells’ main sources of energy for growth, proliferation, and metastasis. ([Location 4330](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0744GMHSQ&location=4330))
    - Tags: [[health]] 
- However, this is an extremely inefficient way to acquire cellular energy. The fact that cancer cells rely on lactate fermentation raises the question, why do cancer cells favor this inefficient method of producing energy? Could it be that they have an impaired ability to properly use mitochondria for energy production? ([Location 4333](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0744GMHSQ&location=4333))
- Together, these findings suggest that mitochondrial function (rather than the nucleus itself) may play a large role in determining whether a cell is cancerous or not—or ([Location 4349](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0744GMHSQ&location=4349))
- If you look at PET scans of a tumor, you will see a drastic increase in glucose uptake (Groves et al., 2007). Cancer cells have remarkably higher rates of glucose uptake than normal cells, resulting in a high cellular glycolytic flux and lactate production. ([Location 4366](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0744GMHSQ&location=4366))
- all cells possess the ability to transition to this method of metabolism (lactate fermentation), but it typically occurs only when oxygen availability is low (hypoxia). While it is true that cancer cells often display a hypoxic (low-oxygen) environment, what makes them unique is their ability to ferment lactate in the presence of oxygen, a process called aerobic glycolysis (Racker et al., 1972). ([Location 4375](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0744GMHSQ&location=4375))
- Therefore, if we were able to provide an alternative source of fuel while limiting the production of the cancer cells’ preferred fuel source (glucose), it could have a significant impact on the cancer cells’ ability to grow and proliferate. ([Location 4378](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0744GMHSQ&location=4378))
- Evidence suggests that there is a direct relationship between high blood glucose levels and tumor growth (Seyfried et al., 2003; Seyfried et al., 2008; Gnagnarella et al., 2008). For this reason, targeting glucose, the major fuel of cancer, could be beneficial in slowing the progression of tumors. ([Location 4406](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0744GMHSQ&location=4406))
- The increase in glucose metabolism in cancer cells ultimately creates a more acidic tumor environment by producing lactate, which can help promote angiogenesis and thereby enhance cancer’s ability to progress. (Gatenby and Gillies et al., 2004). ([Location 4412](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0744GMHSQ&location=4412))
- One by-product of glucose breakdown, lactate, can be used for fuel itself when there is an abundance of it. Because cancer cells increase the breakdown of glucose, they also increase the amount of lactate produced. ([Location 4415](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0744GMHSQ&location=4415))
- Restricting calories and carbohydrates to the point of achieving ketosis is a simple way to use diet to restrict glucose and thereby starve cancer cells of their primary fuel. ([Location 4429](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0744GMHSQ&location=4429))
    - Tags: [[health]] 
- the effects of calorie restriction on cancer are not uniform—some types of cancer respond better than others. And the degree of calorie restriction needed to effectively reduce tumor size or possibly even to prevent cancer from developing at all is still not definitively known. ([Location 4475](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0744GMHSQ&location=4475))
- fasting for, say, sixteen to twenty-four hours before a chemo treatment sensitizes cancer cells to chemo, a lower dose theoretically would be just as effective on cancer cells as a higher dose. That means less damage to healthy cells, more damage to cancer cells, and fewer side effects for patients. ([Location 4486](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0744GMHSQ&location=4486))
- Additionally, fasting has shown promise in protecting healthy cells during various toxic cancer treatments in both animals and humans (Lee et al., 2012; Safdie et al., 2009). ([Location 4488](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0744GMHSQ&location=4488))
- You might be thinking, “Wouldn’t ketones feed cancer cells, too?” Some of the current literature demonstrates that cancer cells are unable to utilize ketones, likely due to their mitochondrial abnormalities, but there is still much debate on this topic. ([Location 4501](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0744GMHSQ&location=4501))
- Restricting carbohydrate and sugar intake seems to be ideal, whether or not an individual is on a true ketogenic diet. As discussed earlier, there is a direct relationship between plasma glucose levels and tumor growth; therefore, lowering plasma glucose by reducing carbohydrates seems to be beneficial. ([Location 4508](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0744GMHSQ&location=4508))
- research has shown that eating beef, pork, and processed meat has no association with colorectal cancer, and neither does total or saturated fat intake (Kimura et al., 2007). ([Location 4588](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0744GMHSQ&location=4588))
- In the case of cancer treatment, the “press” could be a calorie-restricted ketogenic diet—maintained consistently to prevent the growth and spread of tumors—while the “pulse” could be things like hyperbaric oxygen therapy, nontoxic drugs, and chemotherapy, which can further shrink tumors and improve health. ([Location 4656](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0744GMHSQ&location=4656))
- While it’s clear that ketosis may have unique benefits that might be helpful for individuals with cancer, there are still questions to be answered, such as what level of ketosis is optimal for these individuals and whether/how a ketogenic diet and supplemental ketones affect cancer differently. ([Location 4764](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0744GMHSQ&location=4764))
- we can suggest what our regimen would be and possible steps that we would take to make ketosis part of our cancer treatment plan. ...
  1. Fast for forty-eight to seventy-two hours to initiate ketosis. ...
  2. Adopt a calorie-restricted ketogenic diet with intermittent fasting—for instance, one or two meals per day. ...
  3. Take medications or supplements that reduce blood glucose, such as metformin, berberine, or, better yet, dihydroberberine. ...
  4. Supplement with exogenous ketones, HMB (a supplement that can prevent muscle protein breakdown), and high-dose probiotics (which can help boost immune function and gut function). ...
  5. Exercise daily, whether that is going on a walk, lifting weights, or a combination of the two. ...
  6. Seek hyperbaric oxygen therapy treatment. ...
  7. Undergo pulsed chemotherapy or radiation based on our doctors’ recommendation.
  (Prior to the actual chemotherapy or radiation, we would supplement with exogenous ketones and fast for at least sixteen hours in an attempt to sensitize cells to the treatment.) ([Location 4777](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0744GMHSQ&location=4777))
#### Section 5: Exercise and Performance
- In Dr. Volek’s study, individuals were able to eat 80 grams or more of carbohydrates and stay in ketosis, while studies involving more sedentary individuals show that they may need to stick to 30 to 50 grams per day or less. ([Location 5195](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0744GMHSQ&location=5195))
- Cyclic ketogenic dieting is a wide-open field, and there are some interesting areas to explore, such as how (and if) a less-aggressive cyclical approach, such as carbing up at just one meal, might make a difference; whether the timing of the higher-carb meal (e.g., just on hard workout days) matters; and how supplemental ketones might affect the results. ([Location 5288](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0744GMHSQ&location=5288))
#### Section 6: New and Emerging Areas of Interest
- The mania and depression that characterize bipolar disorder are associated with a reduction in the brain’s utilization of glucose for energy (Buchsbaum et al., 1997). ... people with bipolar disorder tend to consume more total carbohydrates, sugar, and sweetened drinks than others (Elmslie et al., 2001)—possibly unconsciously trying to self-medicate with sweets in an attempt to feel better in the moment. It’s possible that the high-sugar diets consumed by bipolar individuals are not fueling their brains sufficiently due to impaired brain glucose utilization, thereby contributing further to the disorder. ([Location 5779](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0744GMHSQ&location=5779))
- In addition, insulin resistance is often associated with bipolar disorder and is thought to possibly hamper treatment for the disorder (Calkin et al., 2015). ([Location 5788](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0744GMHSQ&location=5788))
- On the surface, the increase in oxidative stress and insulin resistance seen in individuals with bipolar disorder point to the fact that diet may play a significant role in the condition. On top of that, many of the medications that are used to treat bipolar disorder may cause weight gain and ultimately lead to metabolic syndrome, ([Location 5789](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0744GMHSQ&location=5789))
