## Highlights
- Love is the central command in Scripture and judgment the central prohibition. ([Location 57](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0055PLW0M&location=57))
### Introduction Waking Up to Judgment
- Jesus taught wherever we go, our first responsibility is to bless people (Luke 10:5). ([Location 108](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0055PLW0M&location=108))
- Scripture teaches us to think and speak evil of no one (Titus 3:2; James 4:11). ([Location 109](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0055PLW0M&location=109))
- if we love, we fulfill everything else the Lord requires of us (Matt. 22:39–40; Rom. 13:8, 10; Gal. 5:14) but that if we don’t love, nothing else we do is of any value (1 Cor. 13:1–3). ([Location 137](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0055PLW0M&location=137))
- we like to pass verdicts. ([Location 146](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0055PLW0M&location=146))
- Our judgments are so instinctive to us that we usually do not notice them. Even worse, they are so natural to us that when we do notice them, we often assume we are righteous for passing judgment! ([Location 147](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0055PLW0M&location=147))
- Our fundamental sin is that we place ourselves in the position of God and divide the world between what we judge to be good and what we judge to be evil. And this judgment is the primary thing that keeps us from doing the central thing God created and saved us to do, namely, love like he loves. ([Location 162](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0055PLW0M&location=162))
- The thesis of this book is that love is the central goal of creation and thus of the Christian life, and that its main obstacle is our getting life from our knowledge of good and evil—from our judgment. ([Location 181](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0055PLW0M&location=181))
- the accuser makes us accusers instead of lovers (Rev. 12:10). ([Location 190](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0055PLW0M&location=190))
- And I conclude by discussing how the church is to grow in holiness, even while (and precisely because) it is accepting everyone unconditionally, without judgment (chapter 12). ([Location 195](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0055PLW0M&location=195))
### Part 1 The Trinity and the Goal of Creation
#### chapter 1 Dancing with the Triune God
- Love, as defined by the one who is love, lays down its life for another, however undeserving. ([Location 241](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0055PLW0M&location=241))
- This is the nature of agape love. It is the act of unconditionally ascribing worth to another at a cost to oneself. ([Location 244](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0055PLW0M&location=244))
- The most profound truth of the Bible is that “God is love” (1 John 4:8, 16). ([Location 247](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0055PLW0M&location=247))
