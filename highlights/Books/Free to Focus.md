- most productivity “solutions” actually make things worse. ([Location 315](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07F3DM7C1&location=315))
- our instincts about productivity come from the age of manufacturing when people performed a defined set of repeatable tasks and could improve the bottom line with marginal gains in execution. ... Today we have amazing variety in our tasks and we contribute to the bottom line with new and significant projects, not small improvements on existing processes.

- Taylor’s goal was to find ways to work faster. When you apply that to the knowledge economy, however, the work never seems to end. ([Location 418](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07F3DM7C1&location=418))
- But has your smartphone or tablet magically given you more free time? I bet it’s done just the opposite. ([Location 433](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07F3DM7C1&location=433))
- I define freedom four ways. ... 1. Freedom to Focus. ... 2. Freedom to Be Present. ... 3. Freedom to Be Spontaneous. ... 4. Freedom to Do Nothing. ([Location 492](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07F3DM7C1&location=492))

- the average employee faces a distraction every three minutes. ([Location 503](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07F3DM7C1&location=503))
- most of your breakthrough ideas in your business or personal life come when you’re relaxed enough to let your mind wander.

### 2 Evaluate Determine Your Course
- By passion, I’m talking about work you love, work that energizes you. ([Location 633](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07F3DM7C1&location=633))

- Many people confuse proficiency with aptitude, but they’re not the same. Aptitude is an ability or knack for doing something. Proficiency is something more.

- True productivity is about doing more of what is in your Desire Zone and less of everything else. ([Location 756](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07F3DM7C1&location=756))
