## Highlights
- In the long run, what matters is the average caloric count per day (that is, as averaged across several days—a slightly heavier day followed by a slightly lighter day is fine), not the caloric content of a single meal or snack. ([Location 314](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003P9XC6W&location=314))
- PROTEIN NEEDS Average man Average woman 65 g protein/day 55 g protein/day ([Location 861](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003P9XC6W&location=861))
- If you’re a man, make sure you get at least 65 grams (about 2 ½ ounces) of protein each day; ([Location 865](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003P9XC6W&location=865))
- ...use the following formula: 0.8 g protein per kilogram of body weight per day (or 0.36 g per pound of body weight per day ([Location 869](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003P9XC6W&location=869))
- Every single lipid the body needs can be made by the body itself, with only two exceptions: n-3 and n-6 fatty acids, popularly known, respectively, as the omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids. ([Location 939](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003P9XC6W&location=939))
- Omega-3 and omega-6 are needed in very, very small amounts, and cases of deficiency leading to the death of healthy people are nearly nonexistent. ([Location 955](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003P9XC6W&location=955))
- But, we repeat, unless your health-care practitioner directs you to supplement your diet with fish oil capsules, going easy on common vegetable oils and occasionally eating the omega-3 foods listed in chapter 6 should suffice to keep your omega fatty acids in balance. ([Location 987](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003P9XC6W&location=987))
- Green tea and a range of brightly colored vegetables (especially green, leafy ones, carrots, and beets) and fruits are excellent sources of phytochemicals. ([Location 1126](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003P9XC6W&location=1126))
- Steam vegetables until they have become slightly soft. ([Location 1140](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003P9XC6W&location=1140))
- Eat several servings (at least five, preferably more) of fruit and vegetables every day. ([Location 1149](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003P9XC6W&location=1149))
- Get at least twenty minutes of aerobic exercise at least three times a week. ([Location 1153](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003P9XC6W&location=1153))
- the short version of this advice to is make sure you eat a varied diet that includes less processed food and more fruits and vegetables, and try to run or swim or dance or play tennis or football or soccer (or any other physical activity that will be pleasurable and yet raise a sweat) a few times a week. ([Location 1159](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003P9XC6W&location=1159))
- On an evolutionary timescale, it has only been in the blink of an eye that CR studies have started, ever so slowly, to change people’s mind. And this is because it has only been in the blink of an eye that food shortages have ceased to be a serious threat to the average citizen of Western countries. ([Location 1177](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003P9XC6W&location=1177))
- As humans and animals evolved through periods of want, the message to overeat became encoded into our very genes, as a safety net to ensure the continuation of our species. ([Location 1215](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003P9XC6W&location=1215))
- the aging process has to slow down during a food shortage. ([Location 1239](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003P9XC6W&location=1239))
- what would have been available during difficult times would have been small quantities of seeds, nuts, berries, vegetables, and the occasional very lean meat (very lean, since the game available during a food shortage would itself have had slim pickings). ([Location 1241](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003P9XC6W&location=1241))
- The goal is putting your body into a state where its energy economy is altered such that maintenance and repair are prioritized. ([Location 1658](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003P9XC6W&location=1658))
- With the “weight watcher” strategy, you will plan to lower your body weight by 10 to 25 percent, slowly, over the course of many months, if not a year or two. Early studies of extreme CR initiated in adulthood in laboratory animals did not lengthen life, and in some cases even shortened it.1 The adult body needs time to adjust, at least for more extreme versions of CR. ([Location 1675](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003P9XC6W&location=1675))
- there are health problems sometimes associated with extremely low body weight (more specifically, with a BMI below 14 or 15). ([Location 1680](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003P9XC6W&location=1680))
- Resting pulse (taken the same time each day, under the same conditions, preferably upon waking). Your resting pulse will almost certainly decrease on CR. Most people on long-term CR have resting pulses between 40 and 60. ([Location 1689](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003P9XC6W&location=1689))
- Your body temperature should decrease on CR. Most people on CR have a body temperature 1 to 2 degrees Fahrenheit below their pre-CR body temperature. ([Location 1692](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003P9XC6W&location=1692))
- Most people on CR have a fasting glucose level between 70 and 85 mg/dl. ([Location 1695](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003P9XC6W&location=1695))
- On CR, total cholesterol, LDL, and triglycerides should decrease. HDL should increase. ([Location 1697](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003P9XC6W&location=1697))
- Both systolic and diastolic readings should decrease on CR. Most people on long-term CR have blood pressure between 95/55 and 110/70. ([Location 1699](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003P9XC6W&location=1699))
- T3 should decrease on CR. Most people on CR have values between 55 and 90 ng/dl. ([Location 1702](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003P9XC6W&location=1702))
- Fasting insulin decreases on CR. Fasting insulin is usually between 0.8 and 2.0 mlU/ml in long-term CR practitioners. ([Location 1703](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003P9XC6W&location=1703))
- We know from animal studies that older animals often don’t adapt well to extreme reductions in energy intake. ([Location 1739](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003P9XC6W&location=1739))
- The probability of sticking with a cookie-cutter regimen of foods you don’t like is low. ([Location 1757](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003P9XC6W&location=1757))
- the occasional “cheat” does not derail the regimen, provided you get back on track as soon as you can. ([Location 1776](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003P9XC6W&location=1776))
