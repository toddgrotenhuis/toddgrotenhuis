- “This place isn’t a refuge, it’s a slave market. Why doesn’t anyone see that?” “Who says they don’t see it? It’s just that unwinding makes slavery look good. It’s always the lesser of two evils.” “I don’t see why there have to be any evils at all.” ([Location 2790](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002AKPELI&location=2790))
- You see, a conflict always begins with an issue—a difference of opinion, an argument. But by the time it turns into a war, the issue doesn’t matter anymore, because now it’s about one thing and one thing only: how much each side hates the other.” ([Location 3030](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002AKPELI&location=3030))
- Everyone was so happy to end the war, no one cared about the consequences.” ([Location 3047](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002AKPELI&location=3047))
- there are two types of people who become Juvey-cops. Type one: bullies who want to spend their lives reliving their glory days of high school bullying. Type two: the former victims of type ones, who see every Unwind as the kid who tormented them all those years ago.

- He will only do the wrong thing when it’s the right thing to do. ([Location 3616](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002AKPELI&location=3616))
