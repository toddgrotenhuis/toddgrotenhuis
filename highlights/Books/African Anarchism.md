## Highlights
- freedom does not mean equal access to coercive power (i.e., government via “free” elections), but rather that it means freedom from coercive power ([Location 157](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HK6J3CI&location=157))

- being a slave is being forced to work for other people—as being a master is to live on the labor of other people. ([Location 191](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HK6J3CI&location=191))
- The primary distinguishing factor between the wage worker and the slave is, perhaps, that the wage worker has some capacity to withdraw his or her labor while the slave cannot. ([Location 197](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HK6J3CI&location=197))
- an authority of a different type: one based upon expertise and experience, not coercive power. ([Location 248](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HK6J3CI&location=248))
- Anarchists have always recognized the need for organization. For them, however, the question is what type of organization. ([Location 249](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HK6J3CI&location=249))
- Ultimately, anarchism rejects all struggle for state (political) power, ([Location 251](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HK6J3CI&location=251))
- Anarchism is basically opposed to violence, and to disorder, chaos and terrorism as well. ([Location 262](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HK6J3CI&location=262))
- Anarchists recognize that the state will do anything, no matter how vile, to maintain its own power. ([Location 274](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HK6J3CI&location=274))
- anarchists recognize that means determine ends, ([Location 276](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HK6J3CI&location=276))
- The total collapse of this society would provide no guarantee about what replaced it. Unless a majority of people had the ideas and organization sufficient for the creation of an alternative society, we would see the old world reassert itself ([Location 278](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HK6J3CI&location=278))
- the foundation of anarchist theory lies in the rejection of coercion. ([Location 389](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HK6J3CI&location=389))
- embrace voluntary association, voluntary cooperation, persuasion, education, and mutual aid. ([Location 391](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HK6J3CI&location=391))
- Anarchists recognize that means determine ends, and thus the means that anarchists embrace (voluntary association, cooperation, mutual aid, etc.) must necessarily be congruent with their ends. ([Location 392](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HK6J3CI&location=392))

- In the long run, this strategy will bear good fruit—a free and equal society; but in the short term this means that quick fixes are unlikely. ([Location 393](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HK6J3CI&location=393))
- Assuming that this were logical and feasible, it would still amount, in the transitional period, to fighting old tyrannies with new ones. ([Location 500](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HK6J3CI&location=500))
- In other words, the marxists advocated not the abolition of coercive state power, but merely the substitution of a new dominator class for the old one at the helm of the state. ([Location 505](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HK6J3CI&location=505))
- Freedom can be created only by freedom. ([Location 531](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HK6J3CI&location=531))
- “It is undeniable that the rule of a majority may be almost as hostile to freedom as the rule of a minority: ([Location 535](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HK6J3CI&location=535))
- To a greater or lesser extent, all of these traditional African societies manifested “anarchic elements ([Location 636](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HK6J3CI&location=636))
- the ideals underlying anarchism may not be so new in the African context. What is new is the concept of anarchism as a social movement or ideology. ([Location 639](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HK6J3CI&location=639))
- there is not as yet a systematic body of anarchist thought that is peculiarly African in origin. ([Location 641](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HK6J3CI&location=641))
- communalism. The term is used here in two senses. First, it denotes a definite mode of production or social formation that comes generally, though not inevitably, after hunter-gatherer societies, and in turn precedes feudalism. ([Location 644](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HK6J3CI&location=644))
- 1) different communities enjoy (near) unfettered independence from one another; 2) communities manage their own affairs and are for all practical purposes self-accounting and self-governing; and 3) every individual without exception takes part, either directly or indirectly, in the running of community affairs at all levels. ([Location 648](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HK6J3CI&location=648))
- Among the most important features of African communalism are the absence of classes, that is, social stratification; the absence of exploitative or antagonistic social relations; the existence of equal access to land and other elements of production; equality at the level of distribution of social produce; and the fact that strong family and kinship ties form(ed) the basis of social life in African communal societies. ([Location 654](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HK6J3CI&location=654))
- Political organization under communalism was horizontal in structure, characterized by a high level of diffusion of functions and power. ([Location 667](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HK6J3CI&location=667))
- Elders presided at meetings and at the settlement of disputes, but hardly in the sense of superiors; their position did not confer the far-reaching sociopolitical authority associated with the modern state system, or with feudal states. ([Location 671](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HK6J3CI&location=671))
- In traditional societies, Africans reached major decisions through consensus, not by voting. ([Location 684](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HK6J3CI&location=684))
- The rise of age grades was in itself a response to the need for greater communal solidarity, since age grades cut across families and lineages. ([Location 705](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HK6J3CI&location=705))
    - Note: Matrix-style cross sections. Is this more or less anarchic?
- Secret societies also performed judicial functions, ([Location 710](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HK6J3CI&location=710))
