## Highlights
### 1 MEETINGS ACROSS THE TREE OF LIFE
- One of the most important developments in animal psychology over the last few decades has been the realization of how smart crows and parrots are. ([Location 95](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01FQRPIIA&location=95))
- Cephalopods are an island of mental complexity in the sea of invertebrate animals. Because our most recent common ancestor was so simple and lies so far back, cephalopods are an independent experiment in the evolution of large brains and complex behavior. If we can make contact with cephalopods as sentient beings, it is not because of a shared history, not because of kinship, but because evolution built minds twice over. This is probably the closest we will come to meeting an intelligent alien. ([Location 119](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01FQRPIIA&location=119))
- They evolved the creeping of worms, the buzzing of gnats, the global voyages of whales. As part of all this, at some unknown stage, came the evolution of subjective experience. For some animals, there’s something it feels like to be such an animal. There is a self, of some kind, that experiences what goes on. ([Location 129](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01FQRPIIA&location=129))
- When we imagine the lives and experiences of simpler animals, we often wind up visualizing scaled-down versions of ourselves. Cephalopods bring us into contact with something very different. ([Location 135](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01FQRPIIA&location=135))
- At this point, some might say that we already know the outlines of the story: brains evolve, more neurons are added, some animals become smarter than others, and that’s it. To say that, though, is to refuse to engage with some of the most puzzling questions. What are the earliest and simplest animals that had subjective experience of some kind? Which animals were the first to feel damage, feel it as pain, for example? Does it feel like something to be one of the large-brained cephalopods, or are they just biochemical machines for which all is dark inside?

- The book aims, then, to treat the mind and its evolution, and to do so with some breadth and depth. The breadth involves thinking about different sorts of animals. The depth is depth in time, as the book embraces the long spans and successive regimes in the history of life. ([Location 162](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01FQRPIIA&location=162))
#### 2 A HISTORY OF ANIMALS
- In order for any organism to do this, one part of it must be receptive, able to see or smell or hear, and another part must be active, able to make something useful happen. ([Location 183](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01FQRPIIA&location=183))
- Once the same chemicals are being sensed and produced, there is the possibility of coordination between cells. We have reached the birth of social behavior. ([Location 218](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01FQRPIIA&location=218))
- The chemistry of life is an aquatic chemistry. We can get by on land only by carrying a huge amount of salt water around with us. ([Location 230](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01FQRPIIA&location=230))
