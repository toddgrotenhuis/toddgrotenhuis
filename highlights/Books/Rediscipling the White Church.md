## Highlights
### FOREWORD BY BRENDA SALTER MCNEIL
- It is deeply disturbing that so many Christians think that racial reconciliation is some kind of liberal, politically motivated social agenda that has nothing to do with their faith as followers of Jesus Christ. It is also an indictment on the church that so many Christians are discipled and don’t know that the gospel includes reconciliation across racial, gender, ethnic, social, and cultural barriers. Discipleship is an invitation to follow Jesus into a new community. We are called to make disciples who create corporate, social change as a part of a new community that loves the Lord with all our heart, mind, soul, and strength, and loves our neighbor as ourselves. Unfortunately, since so many Christians have not heard this message, there is an urgent need for rediscipling in the Christian community.

### INTRODUCTION TO PART ONE FROM CHEAP DIVERSITY . . .
- the segregation inherent in the Christianity I grew up in is not neutral or merely a reflection of individual choices and preferences. ([Location 101](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07ZG795VM&location=101))
- As a group, white evangelicals are 76 percent racially homogeneous while mainline Protestant denominations are 86 percent white. Though some denominations are racially diverse, the individual congregations within them are overwhelmingly not. Using a sociological definition, no more than 12 to 14 percent of American congregations are racially mixed. ([Location 106](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07ZG795VM&location=106))
- With all its ugly implications, segregation is the right word for what we have long ignored. It’s just that now, in the endless culture wars fought on cable news and social media, it’s harder to miss how segregation undermines the witness of the body of Christ. ([Location 112](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07ZG795VM&location=112))
- the segregation within white Christianity is not fundamentally a diversity problem: it’s a discipleship problem. Addressing white Christianity’s lack of diversity without first reckoning with our discipleship would be like redecorating a house built on a failing foundation. Before white churches pursue racial, ethnic, and cultural diversity as the solution to our segregation, we must first address the discipleship that led to our segregation in the first place. ([Location 117](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07ZG795VM&location=117))

- These days we seem more committed to culture wars than to proclaiming the gospel of the kingdom of God. ([Location 123](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07ZG795VM&location=123))
- Our imaginations, desires, and assumptions are constantly shaped by historically rooted and socially constructed racial narratives that result in our segregation. Instead of identifying and resisting these false narratives, most of our Christian discipleship practices have ignored them, and in doing so we have told generations of white Christians that Jesus has nothing to say about racial injustice and segregation. ([Location 128](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07ZG795VM&location=128))
- What matters initially is what has always been most important to the church: a commitment to Jesus’ command to make disciples, now reimagined to form white Christians away from segregation and into solidarity with the body of Christ. ([Location 148](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07ZG795VM&location=148))
- The problem I’m addressing—segregating discipleship—originates in white churches. White ministry leaders are responsible for addressing this corporate sin and leading their communities closer to the way of Jesus. ([Location 152](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07ZG795VM&location=152))
### CHAPTER ONE DISCIPLED BY RACE
- it’s not that most of us are consciously choosing these racial biases; they’ve simply attached themselves to our imaginations and assumptions. ([Location 187](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07ZG795VM&location=187))
- discipleship is not limited to Christianity. There is another kind of discipleship at work on us, and it has been mostly invisible to white Christians. ([Location 194](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07ZG795VM&location=194))
- two discipleships: Christian discipleship that nurtures solidarity across cultural lines of division and the racial discipleship that builds walls of segregation and fosters racial injustice. ([Location 198](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07ZG795VM&location=198))
- it’s important to notice that there is nothing uniquely Christian about discipleship. Basically, we’re thinking about the relationship between a student and her teacher in which the student follows the teacher to become like her teacher in order to do what the teacher does. ([Location 209](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07ZG795VM&location=209))
- The educational goal for most of us was the transfer of knowledge from one person to another. But the teacher-disciple relationship is just that: a relationship, through which the student takes on the character of the teacher in order to enact the teacher’s authority. ([Location 212](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07ZG795VM&location=212))
- “follow-become-do” ([Location 214](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07ZG795VM&location=214))
- While there is more that could be said about what a disciple is, for our purposes a Christian disciple follows Jesus to become like him and to do what he does. ([Location 224](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07ZG795VM&location=224))

- It assumes that we move through the world directed mostly by our minds, as rational beings who think our way toward the good and away from what is sinful. But as Saint Augustine knew, humans are not mostly thinking or believing beings: we are creatures of desire whose loves orient us through the world. ([Location 231](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07ZG795VM&location=231))
- Addressing what is wrong within white Christianity must begin with our desires and loves. ([Location 245](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07ZG795VM&location=245))
- Understanding people as desiring beings whose assumptions are aimed by unconscious habits gets us closer to understanding how disciples are made and why discipleship is the way to address racial segregation within white Christianity. ([Location 262](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07ZG795VM&location=262))
- The ways we have forced God’s righteous and peaceful rule into our violent and exploitative agendas shows how often our own imaginations have failed us. ([Location 288](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07ZG795VM&location=288))
- A social imaginary is “the way ordinary people ‘imagine’ their social surroundings, and this is often not expressed in theoretical terms, it is carried in images, satires, legends, etc.” ([Location 292](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07ZG795VM&location=292))
    - Tags: [[definition]] 
- As Christians who worship King Jesus, our desires are meant to orient us toward his kingdom. Yet like Jesus’ first disciples, the way we imagine the world at the deepest level of our being is often at odds with the kingdom Jesus announced and inaugurated. So any vision for making Christian disciples must account for the kingdom of God as well as those competing kingdoms that disorder and disorient our desires. Otherwise, like Jesus’ first disciples, we’ll be confused or we’ll even reject the very kingdom Jesus came to announce. And as we’ll see, racial discipleship is sustained by a social imaginary directly opposed to the kingdom of God. ([Location 297](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07ZG795VM&location=297))
- Christian disciples are made, then, as they follow Jesus (into the kingdom of God) to become like Jesus (through habit-shaping practices that orient their desires) in order to do what Jesus does. ([Location 307](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07ZG795VM&location=307))
- If the very center of Christian faith—the crucifixion of Jesus—proclaims reconciliation across cultural divisions, then so much of what we find in the New Testament flows naturally: Jesus prays for our unity (John 17:20-21); the Holy Spirit grants the gift of tongues at Pentecost that the gospel might be proclaimed to the multilingual nations (Acts 2:1-12); Philip is sent to baptize the Ethiopian eunuch (Acts 8:26-40); Peter is sent to eat with Cornelius, the Roman centurion (Acts 10); and, by the thirteenth chapter of Acts, we find the first multicultural church, pastored by diverse leaders who were reconciled by the gospel (Acts 13:1). These early disciples had been formed toward a vision of the kingdom of God that was experienced as a new family comprised of former cultural enemies. ([Location 315](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07ZG795VM&location=315))
- More than any other religious group, white evangelicals believe that increasing cultural diversity in the United States is a negative development—this despite the fact that the majority of new immigrants are Christians. ([Location 332](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07ZG795VM&location=332))
- For the most part, white Christianity is not making disciples who reflect and announce the division-healing kingdom of God, and the evidence is plain to see. ([Location 337](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07ZG795VM&location=337))
- Maybe the choice of where to live doesn’t seem like a racial practice, but it’s that very hiddenness that often characterizes how social practices function. ([Location 380](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07ZG795VM&location=380))
### CHAPTER TWO CONCEALED BY RACE
- Yet as instances of visible racial injustice seemed to increase in recent years, these people of color often experienced a deafening silence from the white people in their churches, including their pastors. ([Location 437](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07ZG795VM&location=437))
- Sociologists define a multiracial church as one in which no one racial group makes up more than 80 percent of the congregation. ([Location 450](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07ZG795VM&location=450))
- So white Christians are often left oblivious—like the people Baldwin encountered during his travels through the South, they’re unable to see what people of color cannot afford not to see. ([Location 465](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07ZG795VM&location=465))
- In effect, white people are, to quote James Baldwin again, “still trapped in a history which they do not understand; and until they understand it, they cannot be released from it.”5 Then let’s try to understand. ([Location 468](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07ZG795VM&location=468))
- To adequately disciple white Christians away from racial segregation and injustice, our discipleship practices need to account for racism beyond individual people and decisions. This is exactly what white Christianity has failed to do. ([Location 501](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07ZG795VM&location=501))
- Emerson and Smith identify three tools that white evangelical Christians use to organize and assess our experiences: freewill individualism, relationalism, and antistructuralism. ([Location 504](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07ZG795VM&location=504))
- while there are important differences between white Christianity’s conservative and progressive approaches to racial reconciliation, both have failed to genuinely resist the sources of segregation and injustice. ([Location 512](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07ZG795VM&location=512))
- Freewill individualists display a type of American individualism that downplays the importance of institutions while raising the importance of personal accountability. ([Location 514](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07ZG795VM&location=514))
    - Tags: [[definition]] 
- Relationalism is the next tool preferred by white Christians. It makes sense that a theological movement that prioritizes the restoration of a person’s individual relationship with God would highly value interpersonal relationships. Extending this emphasis beyond personal salvation, these Christians believe that social problems are simply a reflection of broken relationships. ([Location 523](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07ZG795VM&location=523))
- White Christianity is willing to acknowledge that racism has kept people apart, but its focus on personal relationships makes it almost impossible to see the systemic nature of our racialized society. ([Location 527](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07ZG795VM&location=527))
- The last tool used by white Christians is antistructuralism. By prioritizing interpersonal relationships as the way to address racial injustice, any focus on unjust social structures is viewed as shifting guilt from the actual source, the individual. ([Location 531](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07ZG795VM&location=531))
    - Tags: [[definition]] 
- While Wells’s Christian faith compelled her to think about societal sin and systemic injustice and to respond accordingly, for Moody the focus was squarely on the individual’s salvation. This isn’t to say the evangelist was completely oblivious to social concerns; his ministry began through an outreach to poor, uneducated youth. But despite the well-known scourge of lynchings, Moody, like most of his white Christian contemporaries, looked away. ([Location 578](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07ZG795VM&location=578))
- Our definition of discipleship implies the lifelong formation of communities of Christians: Following Jesus (into the kingdom of God) to become like Jesus (through habit-shaping practices that orient our desires) in order to do what Jesus does. ([Location 594](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07ZG795VM&location=594))
    - Tags: [[definition]] [[favorite]] 
- Because individualism is the first challenge, it’s important to realize that a discipleship approach to racial justice and reconciliation depends on a community of Christians. ([Location 599](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07ZG795VM&location=599))
- As basic as the corporate nature of the faith is to Christianity, it can be a hard thing to remember in a society that holds individuality as one of its highest values. ([Location 605](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07ZG795VM&location=605))
- As the cultural majority in this country, the problem for white people is that we don’t think of ourselves as a distinctive culture but as the neutral standard by which other cultures are categorized. ([Location 618](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07ZG795VM&location=618))
- When I begin a conversation with something like, “As a white man . . .” I am acknowledging the way our racialized society has categorized me and, more difficult to admit, the ways I’ve internalized this racial sorting. This doesn’t mean that I should only be known by my white identity; my extended family, diverse neighborhood, and church community are all groups wherein I am shaped and known. But it does mean that, in order to resist the hyperindividualism that typically subverts white Christians’ attempts at racial justice, I must come to see that I am not culturally neutral but a member of a particular racial and cultural group. ([Location 626](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07ZG795VM&location=626))
- Because white Christians reduce systemic racial inequity to broken relationships influenced by personal prejudice, the most common approach to addressing racial injustice has to do with building or restoring personal relationships. ([Location 635](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07ZG795VM&location=635))
- The basic problem of relationalism that Harvey notes—that it does not fundamentally address the causes of segregation and injustice—is why we must begin not by pursuing racial diversity but with discipleship. It is also why, as important as racial reconciliation is, __our goal is not to make every white church racially diverse but to move these churches toward lived solidarity with the entire body of Christ__. By acknowledging and confronting racial discipleship, our reimagined discipleship practices will begin forming communities to confess and confront the conditions that cause segregation and injustice. ([Location 647](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07ZG795VM&location=647))
- While welcoming people of color into our congregations or ministries would scratch our relational itch, the underlying factors related to our segregation remain unaddressed. ([Location 652](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07ZG795VM&location=652))
- In contrast, by reorienting our desires and imaginations toward the reconciled kingdom of God—a formation involving the reshaping of long-held, often unconscious racial habits—we are doing the difficult work of facing our complicity with the injustices suffered by our family in Christ. We are also committing to the sacrificial journey of solidarity that, while certainly relational in character, will lead us to confront the material sources of our segregation. This is a risky journey, one that requires deeply formed love for our King and his kingdom. ([Location 653](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07ZG795VM&location=653))
- We cannot afford to ignore the powerful effects of systems and structures in our pursuit of racial reconciliation and justice. ([Location 662](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07ZG795VM&location=662))
- To spiritually form white Christians in the face of racialized cultural structures, our discipleship practices will need to be sustained by healthy structures of our own. After all, we are not expecting individual white Christians to disciple themselves out of segregation. Instead, community structures that will continually call white Christians to faithful discipleship must be built and nurtured. ([Location 664](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07ZG795VM&location=664))
- By beginning with discipleship, we are acknowledging white Christianity’s dependence on individualism and beginning to see ourselves as a people with a shared culture; we are acknowledging our dependence on relationalism and beginning to confess the systemic roots of our segregation; and we are acknowledging our historic distrust of structures and beginning to build healthy systems and rhythms that sustain our discipleship to Jesus and his reconciled kingdom. ([Location 676](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07ZG795VM&location=676))
### CHAPTER THREE WOUNDED BY RACE
- White Christianity has generally failed to make disciples of God’s reconciled kingdom: people who follow Jesus to become like Jesus in order to do what Jesus does. Our collective failure to acknowledge and account for the racial practices that shape our desires and imaginations has led to segregation within the body of Christ. Rather than resisting the sinful narrative of racial difference, we have left people to be oriented away from the reconciled kingdom of God by habits that are constantly being shaped—and warped—by our racialized society. Our dependence on the tools of individualism, relationalism, and antistructuralism mean that when white Christianity has tried to tackle segregation and racial justice, our efforts have typically failed or simply perpetuated white cultural assumptions. ([Location 735](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07ZG795VM&location=735))
- As desiring beings, it is our hearts that need transformation, and this cannot be accomplished simply by receiving new information. We need to feel the impact of our segregation on our own lives as well as on the lives of people of color and their communities. In other words, we need to lament. ([Location 754](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07ZG795VM&location=754))
- We must not allow our focus on the big picture to distract us from the actual decisions white Christians make, which produce particular hardships and sufferings in other people’s lives. Yes, it is true that we have been racially discipled by a deceived and destructive society. But it’s also true that this discipleship is expressed and encouraged by the decisions we ourselves make. And these choices, hard as this may be to confess, reveal our complicity with the racialized society that has long been at work on our desires and imaginations. ([Location 759](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07ZG795VM&location=759))
- Racism is prejudice based on socially constructed differences in order to benefit some while oppressing others. ([Location 776](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07ZG795VM&location=776))
    - Tags: [[definition]] 
- those who are neither black nor white—Asian Americans and Latinos/as for example—often find themselves on the outside looking in when it comes to finding a place within the nation’s complicated racial landscape. ([Location 883](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07ZG795VM&location=883))
### INTRODUCTION TO PART TWO . . . TO TRUE SOLIDARITY.
- BECAUSE IT HAS BEEN DEFECTIVE DISCIPLESHIP that has led to white Christianity’s segregation, we must begin not by pursuing racial, ethnic, or cultural diversity but by addressing our discipleship practices. ([Location 973](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07ZG795VM&location=973))
- The second reason for making solidarity our goal is that every expression of white Christianity can pursue gospel reconciliation immediately. ([Location 1004](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07ZG795VM&location=1004))
### CHAPTER FOUR PRACTICING TABLE FELLOWSHIP
- The very act of receiving the body and blood of Jesus was evidence either of our delusion or, perhaps, of our mustard seed–sized faith that the cross of Jesus was more powerful than this world’s hatred. I believe it was the latter and that, in that terrible and tender moment, our community was being discipled. ([Location 1111](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07ZG795VM&location=1111))
#### 1. SERVICE
#### 2. SUBMISSION
#### 3. REFLECTION
- In some Communion liturgies the congregation will be asked to examine their hearts before receiving the sacraments, the language being borrowed from 1 Corinthians 11:28: “Everyone ought to examine themselves before they eat of the bread and drink from the cup.” The current of individualism that runs so deeply through white Christianity leads us to think of this important part of the Lord’s Supper in highly individualistic terms. So, for example, we might recall an unacknowledged sin that can be confessed before coming to the table. This is all well and good, but the context for Paul’s admonition to examine ourselves is one in which class divisions and disparities had not been dismantled by the church. He is urging the church to consider how they, corporately, had succumbed to their society’s divisive hierarchies. ([Location 1199](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07ZG795VM&location=1199))
#### 4. FEASTING
#### LAMENT
#### SERVE
#### COLLABORATE
#### EAT
- Many white churches host other congregations in their buildings. I know of one church that hosts an African-American church and multiple immigrant congregations. Each weekend in this church facility you will find incredible cultural diversity. Yet typically, there is very little engagement between congregations in a setting such as this. But what if a quarterly or monthly time was set aside for all of the congregations to gather together over a potluck dinner? ([Location 1318](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07ZG795VM&location=1318))
### CHAPTER FIVE PRACTICING KINGDOM PREACHING
