## Highlights
- We tend to overestimate what we can do in a short period, and underestimate what we can do over a long period, ([Location 205](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B77UE4W&location=205))
- You see yourself do the work, which shows you that you can do the work. ([Location 239](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B77UE4W&location=239))
- “The days are long, but the years are short,” ([Location 254](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B77UE4W&location=254))
- “It’s the task that’s never started that’s more tiresome,” ([Location 254](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B77UE4W&location=254))
- The notion that I do my work here, now, like this, even when I do not feel like it, and especially when I do not feel like it, is very important. ([Location 277](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B77UE4W&location=277))
- you are only going to become a professional if you do it when you don’t feel like it. And that emotional waiver is why this is your work and not your hobby. ([Location 279](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B77UE4W&location=279))
- We’re being asked, in other words, to simultaneously resist and embrace distraction to advance in our careers—a troubling paradox. ([Location 458](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B77UE4W&location=458))
- When confronted with an additional task afterward, those who had to resist the video performed worse than those who were allowed to watch it.5 ([Location 549](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B77UE4W&location=549))
- In short, committing to ignore distractions is rarely enough. Like Franzen, we must strive to remove them entirely from our field of attention. Otherwise, we’ll end up using half our mental energy just keeping ourselves from breaking our own rules. ([Location 550](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B77UE4W&location=550))
- Participants who hadn’t been allowed to finish the puzzle task responded more quickly to words that had been featured in it, or that reflected its goals (e.g., “solve”). Because they hadn’t finished that first task, it was still niggling away in their minds. ([Location 561](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B77UE4W&location=561))
- While it feels easy enough to put one task on hold to start another, studies like this are a reminder that we find it very difficult to let go of unfinished challenges. They continue to draw on our mental resources even after we think we’ve switched focus. What’s more, attempting to ignore this mental tug drains us even further. ([Location 565](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B77UE4W&location=565))
- Tasks done on autopilot don’t use up our stockpile of energy like tasks that have to be consciously completed. ([Location 681](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B77UE4W&location=681))
- If you refuse to put yourself in a situation where you might give an imperfect performance, you’ll prevent yourself from receiving the proper feedback, input, and direction necessary for additional growth. ([Location 1351](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B77UE4W&location=1351))
- The Creative Pragmatist Approach: I know there will never be an ideal time to begin so I set aside time to get started on one part of the process. When I get to that time, regardless of whether I feel like doing the work or whether it seems like the most urgent priority at the moment, I get started on what I can do now. At the end of that initial start, I decide when I will move forward on the project again. I understand that the first stage of working on the piece is messy and that the project inevitably will take longer and have more complexity than I initially anticipate. But that’s okay because I have time to adapt and adjust my plans and still meet my goals and create good work. ([Location 1363](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B77UE4W&location=1363))
- The Creative Pragmatist Approach: I define the meaningful end deliverables and then start to clarify the intermediate steps to create them. I look at how much time I have between now and my projected end date. By “time” I mean both number of weeks and number of hours during those weeks to move this project forward. Then I allocate my time budget to the incremental steps, weighted by the reality of the minimum time that it takes to complete the elements and also by the importance of that element to the overall success of the project. Then, as I move through the process, I push myself to keep pace with the goals I’ve set, producing good enough work within the time I have to spend and giving myself permission to circle back if I still have additional hours at the end. This will ensure that I don’t over-invest in less important items and then botch the finish. ([Location 1376](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B77UE4W&location=1376))
- The Creative Pragmatist Approach: I define “finished” as having at least met the minimum requirements for the piece and as knowing that I’ve done the best I could given the time and resources allocated to the project. Saying something is complete doesn’t mean that it can’t be improved upon or elaborated on in the future. It just means that I can submit it and move on to other work. ([Location 1386](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B77UE4W&location=1386))
- The Creative Pragmatist Approach: I appreciate feedback because it helps me to test and refine my work. I may agree or disagree with the input and I can choose how I respond to it. If I never open myself up to others’ insights, I might miss out on something really wonderful. My work is improved and my world is expanded through the input of others.
