## Highlights
### Preface Why build a community?
- communities are simply groups of people who keep coming together over what they care about. ([Location 68](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07TXDDNPR&location=68))
- The secret to getting people together is this: build your community with people, not for them. ([Location 70](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07TXDDNPR&location=70))
- great leaders create more leaders. ([Location 71](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07TXDDNPR&location=71))
- “How do I achieve this by working with my people, not doing it for them?” ([Location 72](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07TXDDNPR&location=72))
- approach community-building as progressive acts of collaboration—doing more with others every step of the way. ([Location 73](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07TXDDNPR&location=73))
- The throughline of our book is this simple concept: “build with.” ([Location 80](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07TXDDNPR&location=80))
- You’ll notice that in this book we do not dig into why humans need community, analyze the current trend of declining communities, or dissect how organized communities achieve political change. ([Location 85](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07TXDDNPR&location=85))

### I Spark the flame
- Pinpoint people you share a purpose with, do something together, and get them talking. ([Location 102](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07TXDDNPR&location=102))
#### Chapter 1 Pinpoint your people
- Find your kindling—those early allies who care about what you care about enough to manifest your idea for a community into an actual gathering of human beings. ([Location 130](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07TXDDNPR&location=130))
- the first people you involve are consequential. They will set the tone and direction for the future of your group. ([Location 132](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07TXDDNPR&location=132))
- To figure out who to focus on, start with two questions: 1. Who do I want to get together? 2. Why are we coming together? ([Location 133](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07TXDDNPR&location=133))
- start with a clear who, then craft a why with that who in mind. ([Location 137](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07TXDDNPR&location=137))
- you are looking for a team of passionate allies who will show up for this community even before it has gained momentum. ([Location 141](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07TXDDNPR&location=141))
- You can find your team of allies by asking yourself a series of more targeted questions: 1. Who do I care about? 2. Who do I share an interest, identity, or place with? 3. Who do I want to help? ([Location 143](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07TXDDNPR&location=143))
- Genuine passion attracts passionate people. ([Location 148](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07TXDDNPR&location=148))
- Focus on two criteria: 1. Who brings the energy—who are the people who already engage, contribute, or attend? ... 2. Assuming that the community flourishes, who will you stick with? ([Location 176](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07TXDDNPR&location=176))
- If the purpose only serves you, your community-building efforts will fall flat. But the more this purpose resonates with your who, the more likely you are to spark a community. ([Location 187](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07TXDDNPR&location=187))
- In order to make sure that your community’s purpose is grounded in your people’s needs, and that it expresses what you can accomplish together, consider: 1. What do my people need more of? 2. What’s the change we desire? 3. What’s the problem only we can solve together? ([Location 196](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07TXDDNPR&location=196))
- The people who care are more powerful than the people who don’t. They alone will help you build a community from scratch. ([Location 212](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07TXDDNPR&location=212))
- communities dedicated to bridging bring different kinds of people together so that they can share assets, ideas, skills, and information. ([Location 217](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07TXDDNPR&location=217))
- communities focused on bonding connect similar types of people for solidarity, reciprocity, and social support. ([Location 220](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07TXDDNPR&location=220))
- Continually revisit these questions: What dimensions are my community members bonding over unintentionally? ... How can I challenge my community to diversify? ([Location 230](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07TXDDNPR&location=230))
#### Chapter 2 Do something together
- kindred spirits operating in silos aren’t a community (yet). ([Location 282](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07TXDDNPR&location=282))
- What is something your people crave that would be better performed or experienced as a group? ([Location 283](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07TXDDNPR&location=283))
- there are three principles that any first community activity should integrate in order to start your group on a collaborative path: Make it purposeful ... Make it participatory. ... Make it repeatable ([Location 312](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07TXDDNPR&location=312))
- What goal or outcome becomes possible only when this specific group of people gets together? ([Location 315](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07TXDDNPR&location=315))
- Every thriving community organizes essential, repeating activities for its members. ([Location 396](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07TXDDNPR&location=396))
- If your early attendees aren’t hungry for more, go back to the drawing board. ([Location 408](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07TXDDNPR&location=408))
- If what you do as a group amplifies what members experience alone, you’re on your way to sparking a community. ([Location 414](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07TXDDNPR&location=414))
#### Chapter 3 Get people talking
### II Stoke the fire
- The missing ingredient in many would-be communities is dedication. ([Location 591](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07TXDDNPR&location=591))
#### Chapter 4 Attract new folks
- Instead of a push, create a pull. Don’t broadcast a mass message to a faceless audience. Rather, work with your members to collectively send a clear, authentic signal about what your community is all about. ([Location 601](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07TXDDNPR&location=601))
- a framework called Public Narrative, which helps students tell stories that will motivate others to join a cause. ([Location 608](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07TXDDNPR&location=608))
    - Tags: [[definition]] 
- Tell the story of self. ... Tell the story of us. ... Tell the story of now. ([Location 614](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07TXDDNPR&location=614))
- When consistently communicated in this way—connecting self, us, and now—your origin story provides others with the language that they’ll need to help spread the word about what makes your community worth joining. ([Location 635](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07TXDDNPR&location=635))
- You can’t force people to spread the word. Instead, ask: How can I make it easier for them to do so on their own terms? ([Location 670](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07TXDDNPR&location=670))
- Co-founder Briana Ferrigno says, “We don’t just want to hear success stories—we want to hear the good, the bad, and the ugly. We want to know how resilience is built.” ([Location 695](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07TXDDNPR&location=695))
- If existing members are helping you grow the community, you’ll reach more people, and in a more authentic way, than you ever could alone. ([Location 757](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07TXDDNPR&location=757))
#### Chapter 5 Cultivate your identity
- One way to cultivate your community’s identity is to equip enthusiastic members with badges. A badge can be anything visual that enables members to telegraph an affiliation. ([Location 806](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07TXDDNPR&location=806))
- Authentic, shared ownership of the group’s identity only fuels a community’s fire. ([Location 838](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07TXDDNPR&location=838))
- Set an intention and develop rituals with your group’s key moments in mind. ([Location 857](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07TXDDNPR&location=857))
- Another way that people bond over their shared identity is by creating language unique to their community. ([Location 861](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07TXDDNPR&location=861))
- As a start, try agreeing on a name for members. A demonym is a word used to describe someone from a certain place. ([Location 864](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07TXDDNPR&location=864))

#### Chapter 6 Pay attention to who keeps showing up
- Only when you own your misstep can you begin to earn back respect. ([Location 985](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07TXDDNPR&location=985))
- when members communicate frustrations to you, it’s a good sign. It means that your people are paying attention and they’re invested in this community, just like you. ([Location 997](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07TXDDNPR&location=997))
### III Pass the torch
- Growing together means taking responsibility as a leader to create more leaders. ([Location 1030](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07TXDDNPR&location=1030))
#### Chapter 7 Create more leaders
- One of the great joys of creating more leaders—finding, vetting, and developing them—will be watching some of them far exceed your expectations. ([Location 1115](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07TXDDNPR&location=1115))
#### Chapter 8 Supercharge your leaders
- With structure, new leaders gain confidence. With freedom, they embrace ownership. ([Location 1242](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07TXDDNPR&location=1242))
- Try not to get caught up in the details. Capture the critical activities. ([Location 1249](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07TXDDNPR&location=1249))
- Which activities are valuable? Which activities are not as valuable, but are still necessary? Which activities don’t help at all? ([Location 1267](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07TXDDNPR&location=1267))
