## Highlights
### INTRODUCTION AN EATER’S MANIFESTO
- Eat food. Not too much. Mostly plants. ([Location 92](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VMFDR2&location=92))
- For while it used to be that food was all you could eat, today there are thousands of other edible foodlike substances in the supermarket. ([Location 98](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VMFDR2&location=98))
- If you’re concerned about your health, you should probably avoid products that make health claims. Why? Because a health claim on a food product is a strong indication it’s not really food, and food is what you want to eat. ([Location 100](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VMFDR2&location=100))
- Most of us no longer eat what our mothers ate as children or, for that matter, what our mothers fed us as children. This is, historically speaking, an unusual state of affairs. ([Location 118](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VMFDR2&location=118))
- Today in America the culture of food is changing more than once a generation, which is historically unprecedented—and dizzying. ([Location 130](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VMFDR2&location=130))
- What is driving such relentless change in the American diet? One force is a thirty-two-billion-dollar food-marketing machine that thrives on change for its own sake. ([Location 131](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VMFDR2&location=131))
- The story of how the most basic questions about what to eat ever got so complicated reveals a great deal about the institutional imperatives of the food industry, nutrition science, and—ahem—journalism, three parties that stand to gain much from widespread confusion surrounding the most elemental question an omnivore confronts. But humans deciding what to eat without professional guidance—something they have been doing with notable success since coming down out of the trees—is seriously unprofitable if you’re a food company, a definite career loser if you’re a nutritionist, and just plain boring if you’re a newspaper editor or reporter. ([Location 154](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VMFDR2&location=154))
- most important thing to know about the campaign to professionalize dietary advice is that it has not made us any healthier. ([Location 161](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VMFDR2&location=161))
- most of the nutritional advice we’ve received over the last half century (and in particular the advice to replace the fats in our diets with carbohydrates) has actually made us less healthy and considerably fatter. ([Location 162](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VMFDR2&location=162))
- Jean-Anthelme Brillat-Savarin, the eighteenth-century gastronomist, drew a useful distinction between the alimentary activity of animals, which “feed,” and humans, who eat, or dine, a practice, he suggested, that owes as much to culture as it does to biology. ([Location 168](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VMFDR2&location=168))
- But if food and eating stand in need of a defense, from whom, or what, do they need defending? From nutrition science on one side and from the food industry on the other—and from the needless complications around eating that together they have fostered. As eaters we find ourselves increasingly in the grip of a Nutritional Industrial Complex—comprised of well-meaning, if error-prone, scientists and food marketers only too eager to exploit every shift in the nutritional consensus. ([Location 170](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VMFDR2&location=170))
- they have constructed an ideology of nutritionism that, among other things, has convinced us of three pernicious myths: that what matters most is not the food but the “nutrient” that because nutrients are invisible and incomprehensible to everyone but scientists, we need expert help in deciding what to eat; and that the purpose of eating is to promote a narrow concept of physical health. ([Location 174](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VMFDR2&location=174))
- Four of the top ten causes of death today are chronic diseases with well-established links to diet: coronary heart disease, diabetes, stroke, and cancer. ([Location 195](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VMFDR2&location=195))
- All of our uncertainties about nutrition should not obscure the plain fact that the chronic diseases that now kill most of us can be traced directly to the industrialization of our food: the rise of highly processed foods and refined grains; the use of chemicals to raise plants and animals in huge monocultures; the superabundance of cheap calories of sugar and fat produced by modern agriculture; and the narrowing of the biological diversity of the human diet to a tiny handful of staple crops, notably wheat, corn, and soy. ([Location 200](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VMFDR2&location=200))
- Early in the twentieth century, an intrepid group of doctors and medical workers stationed overseas observed that wherever in the world people gave up their traditional way of eating and adopted the Western diet, there soon followed a predictable series of Western diseases, including obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and cancer. ([Location 206](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VMFDR2&location=206))
- Nutritionism prefers to tinker with the Western diet, adjusting the various nutrients (lowering the fat, boosting the protein) and fortifying processed foods rather than questioning their value in the first place. ([Location 214](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VMFDR2&location=214))
- Nutritionism is, in a sense, the official ideology of the Western diet and so cannot be expected to raise radical or searching questions about it. ([Location 216](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VMFDR2&location=216))
- most of the damage to our food and health caused by the industrialization of our eating can be reversed. ([Location 220](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VMFDR2&location=220))
- We are entering a postindustrial era of food; for the first time in a generation it is possible to leave behind the Western diet without having also to leave behind civilization. And the more eaters who vote with their forks for a different kind of food, the more commonplace and accessible such food will become. ([Location 246](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VMFDR2&location=246))
### I THE AGE OF NUTRITIONISM
#### ONE   FROM FOODS TO NUTRIENTS
- Say what you will about this or that food, you are not allowed officially to tell people to eat less of it or the industry in question will have you for lunch. But there is a path around this immovable obstacle, and it was McGovern’s staffers who blazed it: Speak no more of foods, only nutrients. ([Location 319](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VMFDR2&location=319))
- Now the culprit is an obscure, invisible, tasteless—and politically unconnected—substance that may or may not lurk in them called saturated fat. ([Location 324](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VMFDR2&location=324))
- When a few years later the National Academy of Sciences looked into the question of diet and cancer, it was careful to frame its recommendations nutrient by nutrient rather than food by food, to avoid offending any powerful interests. ([Location 332](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VMFDR2&location=332))
#### TWO   NUTRITIONISM DEFINED
- Proper names have a way of making visible things we don’t easily see or simply take for granted. ([Location 365](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VMFDR2&location=365))
- The first thing to understand about nutritionism is that it is not the same thing as nutrition. As the “-ism” suggests, it is not a scientific subject but an ideology. ([Location 365](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VMFDR2&location=365))
- Since nutrients, as compared with foods, are invisible and therefore slightly mysterious, it falls to the scientists (and to the journalists through whom the scientists reach the public) to explain the hidden reality of foods to us. In form this is a quasireligious idea, suggesting the visible world is not the one that really matters, which implies the need for a priesthood. For to enter a world where your dietary salvation depends on unseen nutrients, you need plenty of expert help. ([Location 371](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VMFDR2&location=371))
- ...regarding food as being about things other than bodily health—like pleasure, say, or sociality or identity—makes people no less healthy; indeed, there’s some reason to believe it may make them more healthy. ([Location 378](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VMFDR2&location=378))
    - Note: Does this tie to the Naturally Slim idea that we must notice and enjoy and quit when full, rather than shovel in? (yes)
- Liebig’s elevation of protein dominated nutritionist thinking for decades as public health authorities worked to expand access to and production of the master nutrient (especially in the form of animal protein), with the goal of growing bigger, and therefore (it was assumed) healthier, people. (A high priority for Western governments fighting imperial wars.) To a considerable extent we still have a food system organized around the promotion of protein as the master nutrient. ([Location 385](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VMFDR2&location=385))
- Like so many ideologies, nutritionism at bottom hinges on a form of dualism, so that at all times there must be an evil nutrient for adherents to excoriate and a savior nutrient for them to sanctify. ([Location 400](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VMFDR2&location=400))
- Even more than margarine, infant formula stands as the ultimate test product of nutritionism and a fair index of its hubris. ([Location 411](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VMFDR2&location=411))
    - Note: because they keep finding things that we missed in our simplification
#### THREE   NUTRITIONISM COMES TO MARKET
- nutritionism supplies the ultimate justification for processing food by implying that with a judicious application of food science, fake foods can be made even more nutritious than the real thing. ([Location 420](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VMFDR2&location=420))
- The 1938 Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act imposed strict rules requiring that the word “imitation” appear on any food product that was, well, an imitation. ([Location 438](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VMFDR2&location=438))
- Hard to argue with that…but the food industry did, strenuously for decades, and in 1973 it finally succeeded in getting the imitation rule tossed out, ([Location 442](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VMFDR2&location=442))
- in 1973, the FDA (not, note, the Congress that wrote the law) simply repealed the 1938 rule concerning imitation foods. ([Location 452](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VMFDR2&location=452))
- As long as the new fake foods were engineered to be nutritionally equivalent to the real article, they could no longer be considered fake. Of course the operative nutritionist assumption here is that we know enough to determine nutritional equivalence—something that the checkered history of baby formula suggests has never been the case. ([Location 462](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VMFDR2&location=462))
### FOUR   FOOD SCIENCE’S GOLDEN AGE
- You would not think that common food animals could themselves be rejiggered to fit nutritionist fashion, but in fact some of them could be, and were, in response to the 1977 and 1982 dietary guidelines as animal scientists figured out how to breed leaner pigs and select for leaner beef. ([Location 479](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VMFDR2&location=479))
- The Mars Corporation recently endowed a chair in chocolate science at the University of California at Davis, where research on the antioxidant properties of cacao is making breakthroughs, so it shouldn’t be long before we see chocolate bars bearing FDA-approved health claims. ([Location 501](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VMFDR2&location=501))
- Yet as a general rule it’s a whole lot easier to slap a health claim on a box of sugary cereal than on a raw potato or a carrot, with the perverse result that the most healthful foods in the supermarket sit there quietly in the produce section, silent as stroke victims, while a few aisles over in Cereal the Cocoa Puffs and Lucky Charms are screaming their newfound “whole-grain goodness” to the rafters. Watch out for those health claims. ([Location 504](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VMFDR2&location=504))
### FIVE   THE MELTING OF THE LIPID HYPOTHESIS
- You might think that a national fixation on nutrients would lead to measurable improvements in public health. For that to happen, however, the underlying nutritional science and the policy recommendations (not to mention the journalism) based on that science would both have to be sound. This has seldom been the case. ([Location 510](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VMFDR2&location=510))
- we have good reason to believe that putting the nutritionists in charge of the menu and the kitchen has not only ruined an untold number of meals, but also has done little for our health, except very possibly to make it worse. ([Location 516](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VMFDR2&location=516))
- Let me translate: The amount of saturated fat in the diet probably may have little if any bearing on the risk of heart disease, and evidence that increasing polyunsaturated fats in the diet will reduce risk is slim to nil. As for the dangers of dietary cholesterol, the review found “a weak and nonsignificant positive association between dietary cholesterol and risk of CHD.” (Someone should tell the food processors, who continue to treat dietary cholesterol as a matter of life and death.) “Surprisingly,” the authors wrote, “there is little direct evidence linking higher egg consumption and increased risk of CHD”—surprising, because eggs are particularly high in cholesterol. ([Location 545](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VMFDR2&location=545))
- Trans fat is really bad stuff, apparently, fully twice as bad as saturated fat in its impact on cholesterol ratios. If any of the authors of the critical review are conscious of the cosmic irony here—that the principal contribution of thirty years of official nutritional advice has been to replace a possibly mildly unhealthy fat in our diets with a demonstrably lethal one—they are not saying. ([Location 555](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VMFDR2&location=555))
- One other little grenade is dropped in the paper’s conclusion: Although “a major purported benefit of a low-fat diet is weight loss,” a review of the literature failed to turn up any convincing evidence of this proposition. To the contrary, it found “some evidence” that replacing fats in the diet with carbohydrates (as official dietary advice has urged us to do since the 1970s) will lead to weight gain. ([Location 564](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VMFDR2&location=564))
- The lipid hypothesis is quietly melting away, but no one in the public health community, or the government, seems quite ready to publicly acknowledge it. For fear of what exactly? That we’ll binge on bacon double cheeseburgers? More likely that we’ll come to the unavoidable conclusion that the emperors of nutrition have no clothes and never listen to them again. ([Location 568](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VMFDR2&location=568))
- In fact, there have been dissenters to the lipid hypothesis all along, lipid biochemists like Mary Enig (who has been sounding the alarm on trans fats since the 1970s) and nutritionists like Fred Kummerow and John Yudkin (who have been sounding the alarm on refined carbohydrates, also since the 1970s), but these critics have always had trouble getting a hearing, especially after 1977, when the McGovern guidelines effectively closed off debate on the lipid hypothesis. ([Location 570](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VMFDR2&location=570))
- The consensus hinged on two suggestive links that were well established by the early sixties: a link between high rates of cholesterol in the blood and the likelihood of heart disease and a link between saturated fat in the diet and cholesterol levels in the blood. Both these links have held up, but it doesn’t necessarily follow from them that consumption of saturated fat leads to heart disease, unless you can also demonstrate that serum cholesterol is a cause of heart disease and not, say, just a symptom of it. And though evidence for a link between cholesterol in the diet and cholesterol in the blood has always been tenuous, the belief that the former contributed to the latter has persisted, perhaps because it makes such intuitive sense—and perhaps because it has been so heavily promoted by the margarine makers. ([Location 595](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VMFDR2&location=595))
- Fats make up the structure of our cell walls, the ratios between the various kinds influencing the permeability of the cells to everything from glucose and hormones to microbes and toxins. ([Location 614](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VMFDR2&location=614))
### SIX   EAT RIGHT, GET FATTER
- Americans got really fat on their new low-fat diet—indeed, many date the current epidemic of obesity and diabetes to the late 1970s, when Americans began bingeing on carbohydrates, ostensibly as a way to avoid the evils of fat. ([Location 630](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VMFDR2&location=630))
- Basically what we did was heap a bunch more carbs onto our plate, obscuring but by no means replacing the expanding chunk of (now skinless white) animal protein still sitting there in the middle. ([Location 636](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VMFDR2&location=636))
- it was easy for the take-home message of the 1977 and 1982 dietary guidelines to be simplified as follows: Eat more low-fat foods. And that is precisely what we did. ([Location 640](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VMFDR2&location=640))
- It’s hard to imagine the low-fat/ high-carb craze taking off as it did or our collective health deteriorating to the extent that it has if McGovern’s original food-based recommendation had stood: Eat less meat and fewer dairy products. ([Location 643](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VMFDR2&location=643))
- You begin to see how attractive nutritionism is for all parties concerned, consumers as well as producers, not to mention the nutrition scientists and journalists it renders indispensable. The ideology offers a respectable rationale for creating and marketing all manner of new processed foods and permission for people to eat them. Plus, every course correction in nutritionist advice gives reason to write new diet books and articles, manufacture a new line of products, and eat a whole bunch of even more healthy new food products. And if a product is healthy by design and official sanction, then eating lots of it must be healthy too—maybe even more so. ([Location 645](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VMFDR2&location=645))
- Nutritionism might be the best thing ever to happen to the food industry, which historically has labored under the limits to growth imposed by a population of eaters that isn’t expanding nearly as fast as the food makers need it to if they are to satisfy the expectations of Wall Street. ([Location 650](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VMFDR2&location=650))
- Nutritionism solves the problem of the fixed stomach, as it used to be called in the business: the fact that compared to other consumer products, demand for food has in the past been fairly inelastic. ([Location 652](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VMFDR2&location=652))

### SEVEN   BEYOND THE PLEASURE PRINCIPLE
- Harvey Levenstein, who has written two illuminating histories of American food culture, suggests that the sheer abundance of food in America has bred “a vague indifference to food, manifested in a tendency to eat and run, rather than to dine and savor.” To savor food, to conceive of a meal as an aesthetic experience, has been regarded as evidence of effeteness, a form of foreign foppery. ([Location 670](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VMFDR2&location=670))
- Whatever their biological efficacy, all these dietary exertions had the effect of removing eating from social life and pleasure from eating; ([Location 705](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VMFDR2&location=705))
- To make food choices more scientific is to empty them of their ethnic content and history; in theory, at least, nutritionism proposes a neutral, modernist, forward-looking, and potentially unifying answer to the question of what it might mean to eat like an American. It is also a way to moralize about other people’s choices without seeming to. In this, nutritionism is a little like the institution of the American front lawn, an unobjectionable, if bland, way to pave over our differences and Americanize the landscape. Of course in both cases unity comes at the price of aesthetic diversity and sensory pleasure. Which may be precisely the point. ([Location 712](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VMFDR2&location=712))
### EIGHT   THE PROOF IN THE LOW-FAT PUDDING
- The theory is that refined carbohydrates interfere with insulin metabolism in ways that increase hunger and promote overeating and fat storage in the body. ([Location 727](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VMFDR2&location=727))
### NINE   BAD SCIENCE
- The assumptions of nutritionism—such as the idea that a food is not a system but rather the sum of its nutrient parts—pose another set of problems. ([Location 751](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VMFDR2&location=751))
- “The problem with nutrient-by-nutrient nutrition science,” points out Marion Nestle, a New York University nutritionist, “is that it takes the nutrient out of the context of the food, the food out of the context of the diet, and the diet out of the context of the lifestyle.” ([Location 756](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VMFDR2&location=756))
- if you’re a nutrition scientist you do the only thing you can do, given the tools at your disposal: Break the thing down into its component parts and study those one by one, even if that means ignoring subtle interactions and contexts and the fact that the whole may well be more than, or maybe just different from, the sum of its parts. This is what we mean by reductionist science. ([Location 761](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VMFDR2&location=761))
- It’s important also to remind ourselves that what reductive science can manage to perceive well enough to isolate and study is subject to almost continual change, and that we have a tendency to assume that what we can see is the important thing to look at. ([Location 797](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VMFDR2&location=797))
- scientists make a second, related error when they attempt to study the food out of the context of the diet. We eat foods in combinations and in orders that can affect how they’re metabolized. ([Location 809](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VMFDR2&location=809))
    - Note: I've seen this very clearly with my CGM.
- We have barely begun to understand the relationships among foods in a cuisine. ([Location 815](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VMFDR2&location=815))
- how do you correct for the placebo effect in the case of a dietary trial? You can’t: Low-fat foods seldom taste like the real thing, and no person is ever going to confuse a meat entrée for a vegetarian substitute. ([Location 847](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VMFDR2&location=847))
- In ascending order of supposed reliability, nutrition researchers have three main methods for studying the impact of diet on health: the case-control study, the cohort study, and the intervention trial. All three are seriously flawed in different ways. ([Location 860](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VMFDR2&location=860))
- One of the more pernicious aspects of nutritionism is that it encourages us to blame our health problems on lifestyle choices, implying that the individual bears ultimate responsibility for whatever illnesses befall him. ([Location 866](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VMFDR2&location=866))
- a far more powerful predictor of heart disease than either diet or exercise is social class. ([Location 867](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VMFDR2&location=867))
- Scientists study what scientists can see. ([Location 897](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VMFDR2&location=897))
- (This corruption of a control group by popular dietary advice is called the treatment effect.) ([Location 901](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VMFDR2&location=901))
    - Tags: [[definition]] 
- Validation studies” of dietary trials like the Women’s Health Initiative or the Nurses’ Study, which rely on “food-frequency questionnaires” filled out by subjects several times a year, indicate that people on average eat between a fifth and a third more than they say they do on questionnaires. ([Location 907](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VMFDR2&location=907))
- Now that we spend half of our food dollars on meals prepared outside of the home, how can respondents possibly know what type of fats they’re consuming? ([Location 920](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VMFDR2&location=920))
- The uncomfortable fact is that the entire field of nutritional science rests on a foundation of ignorance and lies about the most basic question of nutrition: What are people eating? ([Location 931](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VMFDR2&location=931))
- Orthorexia nervosa is an eating disorder not yet recognized by the DSM-IV, but some psychologists have recently suggested that it’s time it was. They’re seeing more and more patients suffering from “an unhealthy obsession with healthy eating.” ([Location 975](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VMFDR2&location=975))
    - Tags: [[definition]] 
- So this is what putting science, and scientism, in charge of the American diet has gotten us: anxiety and confusion about even the most basic questions of food and health, and a steadily diminishing ability to enjoy one of the great pleasures of life without guilt or neurosis. ([Location 977](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VMFDR2&location=977))
- All three helped to amplify the signal of nutritionism: journalism by uncritically reporting the latest dietary studies on its front pages; the food industry by marketing dubious foodlike products on the basis of tenuous health claims; and the government by taking it upon itself to issue official dietary advice based on sketchy science in the first place and corrupted by political pressure in the second. ([Location 981](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VMFDR2&location=981))
### II THE WESTERN DIET AND THE DISEASES OF CIVILIZATION
#### ONE   THE ABORIGINE IN ALL OF US
#### TWO   THE ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM
- They compiled lists, many of which appeared in medical journals, of the common diseases they’d been hard pressed to find in the native populations they had treated or studied: little to no heart disease, diabetes, cancer, obesity, hypertension, or stroke; no appendicitis, diverticulitis, malformed dental arches, or tooth decay; no varicose veins, ulcers, or hemorrhoids. ([Location 1056](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VMFDR2&location=1056))
- Simply by moving to places like America, immigrants from nations with low rates of chronic disease seemed to quickly acquire them. ([Location 1074](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VMFDR2&location=1074))
- When you adjust for age, rates of chronic diseases like cancer and type 2 diabetes are considerably higher today than they were in 1900. That is, the chances that a sixty-or seventy-year-old suffers from cancer or type 2 diabetes are far greater today than they were a century ago. (The same may well be true of heart disease, but because heart disease statistics from 1900 are so sketchy, we can’t say for sure.) ([Location 1081](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VMFDR2&location=1081))
- These days most of us think of chronic diseases as being a little like the weather—one of life’s givens—and so count ourselves lucky that, compared to the weather, the diseases at least are more amenable to intervention by modern medicine. ([Location 1085](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VMFDR2&location=1085))
- isolated populations eating a wide variety of traditional diets had no need of dentists whatsoever. (Well, almost no need of dentists: The “sturdy mountaineers” of Switzerland, who never met a toothbrush, had teeth covered in a greenish slime—but underneath that Price found perfectly formed teeth virtually free of decay.) ([Location 1120](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VMFDR2&location=1120))
- He found that his native populations were eating a diet substantially higher in vitamins A and D than that of modern Americans—on average ten times as much. This owed partly to the fact that, as was already understood by the 1930s, the processing of foods typically robs them of nutrients, vitamins especially. ([Location 1127](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VMFDR2&location=1127))
- Price found groups that ate diets of wild animal flesh to be generally healthier than the agriculturists who relied on cereals and other plant foods; the agriculturists tended to have somewhat higher levels of tooth decay (though still low by our standards). ([Location 1138](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VMFDR2&location=1138))
- Price noted that many of the peoples he visited particularly prized organ meats, in which he found high levels of fat-soluble vitamins, minerals, and “activator X,” a term of his own invention that is probably vitamin K 2. ([Location 1140](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VMFDR2&location=1140))
- common denominator of good health, he concluded, was to eat a traditional diet consisting of fresh foods from animals and plants grown on soils that were themselves rich in nutrients. ([Location 1143](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VMFDR2&location=1143))
- not only were levels of vitamins A and D much higher in the yellower butter of the pastured animals but the health of the people who subsisted on those animals was better too. ([Location 1146](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VMFDR2&location=1146))
- Compared to the native peoples Price studied, many of whom took pains to return nutrients to the local soil on which they absolutely depended, “our modern civilization returns exceedingly little of what it borrows." ([Location 1159](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VMFDR2&location=1159))
- Price eventually came to see the problem of diet and health as a problem of ecological dysfunction. By breaking the links among local soils, local foods, and local peoples, the industrial food system disrupted the circular flow of nutrients through the food chain. ([Location 1162](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VMFDR2&location=1162))
- The human animal is adapted to, and apparently can thrive on, an extraordinary range of different diets, but the Western diet, however you define it, does not seem to be one of them. ([Location 1166](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VMFDR2&location=1166))
- People would soon lose their patience for attacks on “industrial civilization,” that being precisely what they were depending on to save them in wartime. ([Location 1170](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VMFDR2&location=1170))
- In the years immediately after the war, industrial agriculture (which benefited from the peacetime conversion of munitions to chemical fertilizer and nerve gas research to pesticides) also consolidated its position; ([Location 1172](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VMFDR2&location=1172))
#### THREE   THE INDUSTRIALIZATION OF EATING: WHAT WE DO KNOW
- Our personal health cannot be divorced from the health of the entire food web. ([Location 1201](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VMFDR2&location=1201))
- Health depends heavily on knowing how to read these biological signals: This looks ripe; this smells spoiled; that’s one slick-looking cow. This is much easier to do when you have long experience of a food and much harder when a food has been expressly designed to deceive your senses with, say, artificial flavors or synthetic sweeteners. Foods that lie to our senses are one of the most challenging features of the Western diet. ([Location 1209](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VMFDR2&location=1209))
- Much is at stake when a creature’s food environment changes. For us, the first big change came ten thousand years ago with the advent of agriculture. (And it devastated our health, leading to a panoply of deficiencies and infectious diseases that we’ve only managed to get under control in the last century or so.) The biggest change in our food environment since then? The advent of the modern diet. ([Location 1229](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VMFDR2&location=1229))
- The case of corn points to one of the key features of the modern diet: a shift toward increasingly refined foods, especially carbohydrates. ([Location 1237](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VMFDR2&location=1237))
- Refining grains extends their shelf life (precisely because they are less nutritious to the pests that compete with us for their calories) and makes them easier to digest by removing the fiber that ordinarily slows the release of their sugars. Also, the finer that flour is ground, the more surface area is exposed to digestive enzymes, so the quicker the starches turn to glucose. ([Location 1240](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VMFDR2&location=1240))
- Viewed from this perspective, the history of refining whole foods has been a history of figuring out ways not just to make them more durable and portable, but also how to concentrate their energy and, in a sense, speed them up. ([Location 1245](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VMFDR2&location=1245))
- Refined flour is the first fast food. ([Location 1250](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VMFDR2&location=1250))
- The problem was that this gorgeous white powder was nutritionally worthless, or nearly so. Much the same was now true for corn flour and white rice, the polishing of which (i.e., the removing of its most nutritious parts) was perfected around the same time. ([Location 1263](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VMFDR2&location=1263))
- they found an additional health benefit to eating whole grains that none of the nutrients alone or even together could explain. That is, subjects getting the same amounts of these nutrients from other sources were not as healthy as the whole-grain eaters. ([Location 1285](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VMFDR2&location=1285))
- Here, then, is support for an idea revolutionary by the standards of nutritionism: A whole food might be more than the sum of its nutrient parts. ([Location 1288](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VMFDR2&location=1288))
- The big money has always been in processing foods, not selling them whole, ([Location 1292](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VMFDR2&location=1292))
- In the natural world, fructose is a rare and precious thing, typically encountered seasonally in ripe fruit, when it comes packaged in a whole food full of fiber (which slows its absorption) ([Location 1301](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VMFDR2&location=1301))
- Americans are consuming a diet that is at least half sugars in one form or another—calories providing virtually nothing but energy. ([Location 1307](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VMFDR2&location=1307))
- The energy density of these refined carbohydrates contributes to obesity in two ways. First, we consume many more calories per unit of food; the fiber that’s been removed from these foods is precisely what would have made us feel full and stop eating. Also, the flash flood of glucose causes insulin levels to spike and then, once the cells have taken all that glucose out of circulation, drop precipitously, making us think we need to eat again. ([Location 1308](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VMFDR2&location=1308))
- So here, then, is the first momentous change in the Western diet that may help to explain why it makes some people so sick: Supplanting tested relationships to the whole foods with which we coevolved over many thousands of years, it asks our bodies now to relate to, and deal with, a very small handful of efficiently delivered nutrients that have been torn from their food context. Our ancient evolutionary relationship with the seeds of grasses and fruit of plants has given way, abruptly, to a rocky marriage with glucose and fructose. ([Location 1320](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VMFDR2&location=1320))
- Just like Liebig, whose focus on the macronutrients in the human diet failed to take account of the important role played by micronutrients such as vitamins, Haber completely overlooked the importance of biological activity in the soil: the contribution to plant health of the complex underground ecosystem of soil microbes, earthworms, and mycorrhizal fungi. ([Location 1329](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VMFDR2&location=1329))
- Plants can live on this fast-food diet of chemicals, but it leaves them more vulnerable to pests and diseases and appears to diminish their nutritional quality. ([Location 1332](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VMFDR2&location=1332))
- Fortifying processed foods with missing nutrients is surely better than leaving them out, but food science can add back only the small handful of nutrients that food science recognizes as important today. What is it overlooking? ([Location 1340](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VMFDR2&location=1340))
- We know how to break down a kernel of corn or grain of wheat into its chemical parts, but we have no idea how to put it back together again. ([Location 1342](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VMFDR2&location=1342))
- Destroying complexity is a lot easier than creating it. ([Location 1343](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VMFDR2&location=1343))
- With the rise of industrial agriculture, vast monocultures of a tiny group of plants, most of them cereal grains, have replaced the diversified farms that used to feed us. ([Location 1350](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VMFDR2&location=1350))
- You may not think you eat a lot of corn and soybeans, but you do: 75 percent of the vegetable oils in your diet come from soy (representing 20 percent of your daily calories) and more than half of the sweeteners you consume come from corn (representing around 10 percent of daily calories). ([Location 1354](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VMFDR2&location=1354))
- Why corn and soy? Because these two plants are among nature’s most efficient transformers of sunlight and chemical fertilizer into carbohydrate energy (in the case of corn) and fat and protein (in the case of soy)—if you want to extract the maximum amount of macronutrients from the American farm belt, corn and soy are the crops to plant. (It helps that the government pays farmers to grow corn and soy, subsidizing every bushel they produce.) ([Location 1356](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VMFDR2&location=1356))
- The business model of the food industry is organized around “adding value” to cheap raw materials; its genius has been to figure out how to break these two big seeds down into their chemical building blocks and then reassemble them in myriad packaged food products. ([Location 1360](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VMFDR2&location=1360))

- Today these four crops account for two thirds of the calories we eat. ([Location 1364](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VMFDR2&location=1364))
    - Note: Wheat corn soy rice
- While industrial agriculture has made tremendous strides in coaxing macronutrients—calories—from the land, it is becoming increasingly clear that these gains in food quantity have come at a cost to its quality. This probably shouldn’t surprise us: Our food system has long devoted its energies to increasing yields and selling food as cheaply as possible. ([Location 1369](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VMFDR2&location=1369))
- USDA figures show a decline in the nutrient content of the forty-three crops it has tracked since the 1950s. In one recent analysis, vitamin C declined by 20 percent, iron by 15 percent, riboflavin by 38 percent, calcium by 16 percent. Government figures from England tell a similar story: declines since the fifties of 10 percent or more in levels of iron, zinc, calcium, and selenium across a range of food crops. ([Location 1373](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VMFDR2&location=1373))
- Crops grown with chemical fertilizers grow more quickly, giving them less time and opportunity to accumulate nutrients other than the big three (nutrients in which industrial soils are apt to be deficient anyway). ([Location 1389](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VMFDR2&location=1389))
- Also, easy access to the major nutrients means that industrial crops develop smaller and shallower root systems than organically grown plants; deeply rooted plants have access to more soil minerals. ([Location 1390](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VMFDR2&location=1390))
- Also, a biologically active soil will have more mycorrhizae, the soil fungi that live in symbiosis with plant roots, supplying the plants with minerals in exchange for a ration of sugar. ([Location 1393](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VMFDR2&location=1393))
- Similarly, milk from modern Holstein cows (in which breeders have managed to more than triple daily yield since 1950) has considerably less butterfat and other nutrients than that from older, less “improved” varieties like Jersey, Guernsey, and Brown Swiss. ([Location 1404](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VMFDR2&location=1404))
- And what has happened on the farm has happened in the food system as a whole as industry has pursued the same general strategy of promoting quantity at the expense of quality. ([Location 1408](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VMFDR2&location=1408))
- Since 1980, American farmers have produced an average of 600 more calories per person per day, the price of food has fallen, portion sizes have ballooned, and, predictably, we’re eating a whole lot more, at least 300 more calories a day than we consumed in 1985. What kind of calories? Nearly a quarter of these additional calories come from added sugars (and most of that in the form of high-fructose corn syrup); roughly another quarter from added fat (most of it in the form of soybean oil); 46 percent of them from grains (mostly refined); and the few calories left (8 percent) from fruits and vegetables. ([Location 1413](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VMFDR2&location=1413))
- A diet based on quantity rather than quality has ushered a new creature onto the world stage: the human being who manages to be both overfed and undernourished, two characteristics seldom found in the same body in the long natural history of our species. ([Location 1419](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VMFDR2&location=1419))
- Ames also believes, though he hasn’t yet proven it, that micronutrient deficiencies may contribute to obesity. His hypothesis is that a body starved of critical nutrients will keep eating in the hope of obtaining them. ([Location 1433](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VMFDR2&location=1433))
- unrelenting hunger “may be a biological strategy for obtaining missing nutrients.” ([Location 1436](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VMFDR2&location=1436))
- ...food system organized around quantity rather than quality has a destructive feedback loop built into it, such that the more low-quality food one eats, the more one wants to eats, in a futile—but highly profitable—quest for the absent nutrient. ([Location 1437](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VMFDR2&location=1437))
    - Note: doubly so if in an insulin loop too
- Also, the fact that they come in the form of durable seeds which can be stored for long periods of time means they can function as commodities as well as foods, making these crops particularly well adapted to the needs of industrial capitalism. ([Location 1442](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VMFDR2&location=1442))
- Put in the most basic terms, we’re eating a lot more seeds and a lot fewer leaves (as do the animals we depend on), a tectonic dietary shift the full implications of which we are just now beginning to recognize. ([Location 1446](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VMFDR2&location=1446))
- Most people associate omega-3 fatty acids with fish, but fish get them originally from green plants (specifically algae), which is where they all originate. ([Location 1450](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VMFDR2&location=1450))
- It helps to think of omega-3s as fleet and flexible, omega-6s as sturdy and slow. ([Location 1461](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VMFDR2&location=1461))
- Omega-3s weren’t recognized as essential to the human diet until the 1980s—some time after nutritionism’s blanket hostility to fat had already taken hold. ([Location 1469](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VMFDR2&location=1469))
- For years plant breeders have been unwittingly selecting for plants that produce fewer omega-3s, because such crops don’t spoil as quickly. ([Location 1470](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VMFDR2&location=1470))
- (Wild greens like purslane have substantially higher levels of omega-3s than most domesticated plants.) ([Location 1471](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VMFDR2&location=1471))
- when food makers partially hydrogenate oils to render them more stable, it is the omega-3s that are eliminated. ([Location 1472](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VMFDR2&location=1472))
- the ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 in the typical American today stands at more than 10 to 1. Before the widespread introduction of seed oils at the turn of the last century, the ratio was closer to 3 to 1. ([Location 1480](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VMFDR2&location=1480))
- Of all the changes to our food system that go under the heading “The Western Diet,” the shift from a food chain with green plants at its base to one based on seeds may be the most far reaching of all. ([Location 1528](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VMFDR2&location=1528))
- For the shift from leaves to seeds affects much more than the levels of omega-3 and omega-6 in the body. It also helps account for the flood of refined carbohydrates in the modern diet and the drought of so many micronutrients and the surfeit of total calories. ([Location 1532](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VMFDR2&location=1532))
- The sheer novelty and glamour of the Western diet, with its seventeen thousand new food products every year and the marketing power—thirty-two billion dollars a year—used to sell us those products, has overwhelmed the force of tradition and left us where we now find ourselves: relying on science and journalism and government and marketing to help us decide what to eat. ([Location 1544](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VMFDR2&location=1544))
- Nutritionism, which arose to help us better deal with the problems of the Western diet, has largely been co-opted by it: ([Location 1547](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VMFDR2&location=1547))
- There are a couple of problems with trying simply to get used to the Western diet. ([Location 1560](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VMFDR2&location=1560))
- In order for natural selection to help us adapt to the Western diet, we’d have to be prepared to let those whom it sickens die. Also, many of the chronic diseases caused by the Western diet come late in life, after the childbearing years, a period of our lives in which natural selection takes no interest. Thus genes predisposing people to these conditions get passed on rather than weeded out. ([Location 1564](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VMFDR2&location=1564))
- But though fast food may be good business for the health care industry, the cost to society—an estimated $250 billion a year in diet-related health care costs and rising rapidly—cannot be sustained indefinitely. ([Location 1570](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VMFDR2&location=1570))
- Although an estimated 80 percent of cases of type 2 diabetes could be prevented by a change of diet and exercise, it looks like the smart money is instead on the creation of a vast new diabetes industry. ([Location 1576](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VMFDR2&location=1576))
- Diabetes is well on its way to becoming normalized in the West—recognized as a whole new demographic and so a major marketing opportunity. Apparently it is easier, or at least a lot more profitable, to change a disease of civilization into a lifestyle than it is to change the way that civilization eats. ([Location 1580](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VMFDR2&location=1580))
### III GETTING OVER NUTRITIONISM
#### ONE   ESCAPE FROM THE WESTERN DIET
- People eating a Western diet are prone to a complex of chronic diseases that seldom strike people eating more traditional diets. Scientists can argue all they want about the biological mechanisms behind this phenomenon, but whichever it is, the solution to the problem would appear to remain very much the same: Stop eating a Western diet. ([Location 1605](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VMFDR2&location=1605))
- The food industry needs theories so it can better redesign specific processed foods; a new theory means a new line of products, allowing the industry to go on tweaking the Western diet instead of making any more radical change to its business model. ([Location 1609](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VMFDR2&location=1609))
- For the medical community too scientific theories about diet nourish business as usual. New theories beget new drugs to treat diabetes, high blood pressure, and cholesterol; new treatments and procedures to ameliorate chronic diseases; and new diets organized around each new theory’s elevation of one class of nutrient and demotion of another. ([Location 1613](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VMFDR2&location=1613))
- instead of worrying about nutrients, we should simply avoid any food that has been processed to such an extent that it is more the product of industry than of nature. ([Location 1635](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VMFDR2&location=1635))
- This sounds like a sensible rule of thumb until you realize that industrial processes have by now invaded many whole foods too. ([Location 1636](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VMFDR2&location=1636))
- The steer has itself been raised on a Western diet, and that diet has rendered its meat substantially different ([Location 1638](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VMFDR2&location=1638))
- The steer’s industrial upbringing has also rendered its meat so cheap that we’re likely to eat more of it more often than our ancestors ever would have. ([Location 1640](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VMFDR2&location=1640))
- The idea behind having a simple policy like “avoid foods that make health claims” is to make the process simpler and more pleasurable than trying to eat by the numbers and nutrients, as nutritionism encourages us to do. ([Location 1670](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VMFDR2&location=1670))
#### TWO   EAT FOOD: FOOD DEFINED
- DON’T EAT ANYTHING YOUR GREAT GRANDMOTHER WOULDN’T RECOGNIZE AS FOOD. ([Location 1689](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VMFDR2&location=1689))
- Don’t eat anything incapable of rotting ([Location 1707](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VMFDR2&location=1707))
- One of the problems with the products of food science is that, as Joan Gussow has pointed out, they lie to your body; their artificial colors and flavors and synthetic sweeteners and novel fats confound the senses we rely on to assess new foods and prepare our bodies to deal with them. Foods that lie leave us with little choice but to eat by the numbers, consulting labels rather than our senses. ([Location 1709](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VMFDR2&location=1709))
- AVOID FOOD PRODUCTS CONTAINING INGREDIENTS THAT ARE A) UNFAMILIAR, B) UNPRONOUNCEABLE, C) MORE THAN FIVE IN NUMBER, OR THAT INCLUDE D) HIGH-FRUCTOSE CORN SYRUP. ([Location 1722](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VMFDR2&location=1722))
- Very often food science’s efforts to make traditional foods more nutritious make them much more complicated, but not necessarily any better for you. ([Location 1754](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VMFDR2&location=1754))
- AVOID FOOD PRODUCTS THAT MAKE HEALTH CLAIMS. ([Location 1764](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VMFDR2&location=1764))
- When corn oil and chips and sugary breakfast cereals can all boast being good for your heart, health claims have become hopelessly corrupt. ([Location 1791](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VMFDR2&location=1791))

- Indeed, the surest way to escape the Western diet is simply to depart the realms it rules: the supermarket, the convenience store, and the fast-food outlet. ([Location 1808](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VMFDR2&location=1808))
- When you eat from the farmers’ market, you automatically eat food that is in season, which is usually when it is most nutritious. ([Location 1814](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VMFDR2&location=1814))
- Eating in season also tends to diversify your diet—because you can’t buy strawberries or broccoli or potatoes twelve months of the year, you’ll find yourself experimenting with other foods when they come into the market. The CSA box does an even better job of forcing you out of your dietary rut because you’ll find things in your weekly allotment that you would never buy on your own. ([Location 1815](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VMFDR2&location=1815))
- a diversified farm usually has little need for pesticides; it’s the big monocultures that can’t survive without them.† ([Location 1827](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VMFDR2&location=1827))
- Food reclaims its story, and some of its nobility, when the person who grew it hands it to you. ([Location 1836](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VMFDR2&location=1836))
- So here’s a subclause to the get-out-of-the-supermarket rule: Shake the hand that feeds you. ([Location 1837](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VMFDR2&location=1837))
- Regulation is an imperfect substitute for the accountability, and trust, built into a market in which food producers meet the gaze of eaters and vice versa. ([Location 1841](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VMFDR2&location=1841))
- “Eating is an agricultural act,” Wendell Berry famously wrote, by which he meant that we are not just passive consumers of food but cocreators of the systems that feed us. ([Location 1844](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VMFDR2&location=1844))
#### THREE   MOSTLY PLANTS: WHAT TO EAT
- But antioxidants do something else for us as well: They stimulate the liver to produce the enzymes necessary to break down the antioxidant itself, enzymes that, once produced, go on to break down other compounds as well, including whatever toxins happen to resemble the antioxidant. In this way antioxidants help detoxify dangerous chemicals, including carcinogens, and the more kinds of antioxidants in the diet, the more kinds of toxins the body can disarm. ([Location 1870](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VMFDR2&location=1870))
- (The reason plants are such a rich source of antioxidants is that they need them to cope with all the pure oxygen produced during photosynthesis.) ([Location 1877](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VMFDR2&location=1877))
- What exactly it is in meat we need to worry about (the saturated fat? the type of iron? the carcinogens produced in curing and cooking it?) is unclear; the problem could be simply that eating lots of it pushes plants out of the diet. But eating too much industrial meat exposes us to more saturated fat, omega-6 fatty acids, growth hormones, and carcinogens than we probably want in our diet. ([Location 1905](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VMFDR2&location=1905))
- Meat has both the advantages and disadvantages of being at the top of the food chain: It accumulates and concentrates many of the nutrients in the environment but also many of the toxins. ([Location 1908](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VMFDR2&location=1908))
- For most of our food animals, a diet of grass means much healthier fats (more omega-3s and conjugated linoleic acid, or CLA; fewer omega-6s and saturated fat) in their meat, milk, and eggs, as well as appreciably higher levels of vitamins and antioxidants. ([Location 1919](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VMFDR2&location=1919))
- So the rule about eating more leaves and fewer seeds applies not only to us but also to the animals in our food chain. ([Location 1924](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VMFDR2&location=1924))

- Two of the most nutritious plants in the world are weeds—lamb’s quarters and purslane ([Location 1953](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VMFDR2&location=1953))
- Up to now, all the recommendations I’ve offered here pose no conflict between what’s best for your health and what’s best for the environment. Indeed, most of them support farming and ranching practices that improve the health of the land and the water. But not this one, sorry to say. There are not enough wild animals left for us all to be eating more of them (except perhaps deer and feral pigs), and certainly not enough wild fish. Fortunately, however, a few of the most nutritious fish species, including salmon, mackerel, sardines, and anchovies, are well managed and in some cases even abundant. Don’t overlook those oily little fish. ([Location 1964](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VMFDR2&location=1964))

- Eating spicy foods help people keep cool; many spices also have antimicrobial properties, which is important in warm climates where food is apt to spoil rapidly. And indeed researchers have found that the hotter a climate is, the more spices will be found in the local cuisine. ([Location 1991](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VMFDR2&location=1991))
- If diets are the product of an evolutionary process, then a novel food or culinary innovation resembles a mutation: It might represent a revolutionary improvement, but it probably doesn’t. ([Location 2019](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VMFDR2&location=2019))

- drinking with food is better than drinking without it. (Food blunts some of the deleterious effects of alcohol by slowing its absorption.) Also, a diet particularly rich in plant foods, as the French and Mediterranean diets are, supplies precisely the B vitamins that drinking alcohol depletes.

#### FOUR   NOT TOO MUCH: HOW TO EAT
- How a culture eats may have just as much of a bearing on health as what a culture eats. ([Location 2084](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VMFDR2&location=2084))
- French eat very differently than we do. They seldom snack, and they eat most of their food at meals shared with other people. They eat small portions and don’t come back for seconds. And they spend considerably more time eating than we do. Taken together, these habits contribute to a food culture in which the French consume fewer calories than we do, yet manage to enjoy them far more. ([Location 2089](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VMFDR2&location=2089))
- Turning out vast quantities of so-so food sold in tremendous packages at a terrific price is what we do well. ([Location 2102](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VMFDR2&location=2102))
- Another important benefit of paying more for better-quality food is that you’re apt to eat less of it. ([Location 2108](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VMFDR2&location=2108))
- Calorie restriction has repeatedly been shown to slow aging and prolong lifespan in animals, and some researchers believe it is the single strongest link between a change in the diet and the prevention of cancer. ([Location 2110](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VMFDR2&location=2110))
- Overeating promotes cell division, and promotes it most dramatically in cancer cells; ([Location 2112](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VMFDR2&location=2112))
- cutting back on calories slows cell division. It also stifles the production of free radicals, curbs inflammation, and reduces the risk of most of the Western diseases. ([Location 2113](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VMFDR2&location=2113))
- To borrow Paul Rozin’s term, exceptional food offers us more “food experience”—per bite, per dish, per meal ([Location 2153](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VMFDR2&location=2153))

- The work of growing food contributes to your health long before you sit down to eat it, of course, but there is something particularly fitting about enlisting your body in its own sustenance. Much of what we call recreation or exercise consists of pointless physical labor, so it is especially satisfying when we can give that labor a point. ([Location 2273](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VMFDR2&location=2273))
- To reclaim this much control over one’s food, to take it back from industry and science, is no small thing; indeed, in our time cooking from scratch and growing any of your own food qualify as subversive acts. And what these acts subvert is nutritionism: the belief that food is foremost about nutrition and nutrition is so complex that only experts and industry can possibly supply it.
