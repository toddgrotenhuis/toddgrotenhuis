## Highlights
- When people hesitate to give honest feedback on an idea, draft, or performance, I ask for a 0-10 score.
  No one ever says 10. Then I ask how I can get closer to a 10.
  It motivates them to start coaching me—and motivates me to be coachable. I want to learn how to close the gap. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AdamMGrant/status/1369732419021135879))
