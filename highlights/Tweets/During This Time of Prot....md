## Highlights
- During this time of protest, I know we could all use an uplifting story. So I want to tell you about El Negro Matapacos, the heroic Chilean protest dog who hated the police. https://t.co/quxgmxN7n6
- El Negro Matapacos (“Black Cop Killer”) was a stray dog who began showing up to support Chilean student protestors in 2011. He gained famed for never hurting a civilian, but always turned aggressive against the police. https://t.co/T16J4sNld5
- He was fiercely protective of the protestors, and he would accompany them into the thick of danger. https://t.co/6VWzBiDsWe
- El Negro was always on the front lines. https://t.co/ttWTEj4N5V
- He hated the water canons, but he never retreated. He barked and thrashed and gnashed his teeth. Because he was brave. https://t.co/Mh6NRngC6S
- He gave absolutely zero fucks. Here he is making love to his lady friends in front of the cops’ paint splattered tanks. https://t.co/GVuSndodia
- And he was always there to back up his friends. https://t.co/1RlHNOg0LI
- He understood solidarity. He understood who the violent thugs were. And he was just a dog. https://t.co/lXhznwkqyU
- And he never gave the cops a moment’s peace. https://t.co/XzmYMHrYJe
- El Negro Matapacos has become beloved. 
  https://t.co/Vex35KjwIq
- Beloved is probably too weak of a word. El Negro is approaching canonization. This reads: “Patron saint of protestors and street dogs.” https://t.co/zrV04OXvdp
- He is the subject of street art throughout Chile.

- And more fan art than you can shake a stick at. https://t.co/0SGHAQqeib
- Here is an entire page of tribute art:

- A lot of El Negro Matapacos fan art also features Pare Man, a young man who became a folk hero with his handmade sign and complete lack of fear. https://t.co/EZ4Uq0ZK92
- El Negro died of old age in 2017 under the care of a volunteer veterinarian. But he will always be remembered taking a stand. https://t.co/fRPWwwhfC4
